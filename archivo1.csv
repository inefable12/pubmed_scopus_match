This paper aims to identify these common challenges and provide a conceptual framework for establishing a Digital Twin (DT) system to improve supply chain management performance. The paper presents a systematic literature review of 129 research papers on DT applications for SCM improvement. The selected papers were reviewed and classified into three categories: manufacturing and production, supply chain, and logistics. The development of digital technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices, cloud computing, cyber-physical systems (CPSs), cybersecurity (CS), and simulation modeling has increased the opportunities to explore the creation of supply chain DTs. However, there are limitations and various challenges due to the complexity of most systems. The results indicate that DT for SCM should include external links (i.e. suppliers, distributors) and internal links (i.e. procurement, production, logistics) to deal with any disruption through data-driven modeling with real-time synchronization. Based on the review findings, this study proposes a three-layered conceptual framework to improve supply chain management performance. The proposed framework provides future directions for DT research in SCM. It provides a holistic and integrated approach to DT implementation, the common DT technologies, and data analytics techniques for improved supply chain performance. © 2024","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200546921"

Vertical indoor farming is a promising mode of next-generation agriculture that boasts reduced water and pesticide usage, improved yields, more consistent quality, year-round cultivation, and cheaper transportation and harvesting costs. Indoor farms can rival industrial greenhouses in size, but small-scale “pod farms"" can be deployed to smaller communities and areas where large swaths of land are either unavailable or too costly. These pods are often the size of shipping containers with their temperature, humidity, and plant nutrient supply carefully controlled. Plants inside the pods are grown hydroponically with light supplied by panels of LEDs and, thus, this mode of farming is fundamentally different from greenhouse farming. Many indoor farming pods have recently become commercially available claiming high energy efficiency, but little analysis and optimization work has been done to prove these claims. To drive innovation in the design of these physical systems, we have developed a digital-twin and genomic optimization framework for the optical design of vertical indoor farming pods. We model a completely enclosed indoor farming pod with plants in the three mutually-orthogonal planes and illuminated by LED “walls."" We employ ray-tracing methods and a genetic algorithm to determine the LED source tube area size, beam aperture spread, and power requirements for maximal power absorption by the plants. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178872670"

In the present business scenario, the warehouse management system encounters a messy layout, poor damage control, unsatisfactory order management, lack of visibility and lack of technological interventions. Digital twin (DT) based warehouse system shows the ontology and knowledge graphs for competitive advantage by consolidating and transferring goods directly from an inbound supplier to an outbound customer on short notice and with no or limited storage. There remains a lack of clarity on how the DT can be implemented successfully in warehouse management. Design/methodology/approach: The current literature remains largely unstructured and scattered due to a lack of a systematic approach to integrating the research implications and analysis. This paper probes the conceptualization of the DT with the help of theoretical analysis using the systematic literature analysis method. Findings: The study explores essential concepts such as interoperability and integrability in implementing DT. Further, it analyzes the role of a supply chain control tower (SCCT) in modern supply chain management. A research framework is proposed for practitioners and academicians by incorporating the opportunities and challenges associated with DT implementation. The research findings are mainly threefold: Conceptualization of DT, Featuring SCCT and Exploration of cross-computer platform interfaces, scalability and maintenance strategies. Originality/value: This study is among the first to analyze and review DT applications in warehouse management. Moreover, the study proposes a theoretical toolbox for the practitioners to successfully implement the DT in warehouse DT-based warehouse management system: A theoretical toolbox for future research and applications. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164192827"

The concept of a digital twin—a model of the physical environment that has a real-time two-way link between the physical and the digital, with the virtual model changing over time to reflect changes in the real world—lends itself well to the continually changing environment of a construction project. Predictive capabilities built into a twin also have great potential for construction planning—including in supply chain management and waste disposal as well as in the construction process itself. Underpinning this opportunity is location data, which model where something is happening and when and can be used to solve a wide range of problems. In particular, location (the power of where) can integrate diverse data sources and types into a single system, overcoming interoperability challenges that are known to be a barrier to twin implementation. This paper demonstrates the power of location-enabled digital twins in the context of a highway construction project, documenting and addressing data engineering tasks and functionality development to explore the potential of digital twins in the context of two case studies—health and safety and construction monitoring. We develop two demonstrators using data from an existing construction project (building on data and requirements from industry partner Skanska) to build twins that make use of the powers of 4D data presentation offered by the Unreal Gaming Engine and CesiumJS mapping, while software development expertise is sometimes available to construction firms, we specifically explore to what extent the no-code approach available within Unreal can be deployed in this context. Our findings provide evidence to construction companies as to the benefits of digital twins, as well as an understanding of the data engineering and technical skills required to achieve these benefits. The overall results demonstrate the potential for digital twins to unlock and democratise construction data, taking them beyond the niche use of experts and into the boardroom. © 2024 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199669180"

With the rapid adoption of smart farming technologies and infrastructure, the agricultural sector has become an attractive target for cyberattacks. This paper presents a systematic literature review that assesses the applicability of existing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) techniques within smart farming infrastructures (SFIs). We develop a comprehensive taxonomy of CTI techniques and sources, specifically tailored to the SFI context, addressing the unique cyber threat challenges in this domain. A crucial finding of our review is the identified need for a virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) in smart agriculture. While the concept of a vCISO is not yet established in the agricultural sector, our study highlights its potential significance. The implementation of a vCISO could play a pivotal role in enhancing cybersecurity measures by offering strategic guidance, developing robust security protocols, and facilitating real-time threat analysis and response strategies. This approach is critical for safeguarding the food supply chain against the evolving landscape of cyber threats. Our research underscores the importance of integrating a vCISO framework into smart farming practices as a vital step towards strengthening cybersecurity.

This study evaluates the supply chain risk assessment and management and then selects the best supplier in a gas company in Egypt. A comprehensive methodology can use the experts' opinions who use the linguistic variables in the spherical fuzzy numbers (SFNs) to evaluate the criteria and suppliers in this study based on their views. Selecting the best supplier is a complex task due to various criteria related to supply chain risk assessment, such as supply risks, environmental risks, financial risks, regularity risks, political risk, ethical risks, and technology risks and their sub-criteria. This study suggested a new combined model with multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) under a spherical fuzzy set (SFS) environment to overcome uncertainty and incomplete data in the assessment process. The MCDM methodology has two methods: the Entropy and COmbinative Distance-based Assessment (CODAS) methods. The SFS-Entropy is used to compute supply chain risk assessment and management criteria weights. The SFS-CODAS method is used to rank the supplier. The main results show that supply risks have the highest importance, followed by financial and environmental risks, and ethical risks have the lowest risk importance. The criteria weights were changed under sensitivity analysis to show the stability and validation of the results obtained from the suggested methodology. The comparative analysis is implemented with other MCDM methods named TOPSIS, VIKOR, MARCOS, COPRAS, WASPAS, and MULTIMOORA methods under the SFS environment.

The AFSC-DT behaves as a control tower, providing a multi-dimensional dashboard of indicators and labels to enhance practitioners' and consumers' knowledge of FSC entities and operations. The practitioner's visibility drives top-down operational and tactical feedback controls through real-time monitoring and a-posteriori multi-dimensional performance analysis, whilst consumers, with their informed choices, perform a strategic bottom-up pressure on the food industry toward a sustainable redesign. A what-if simulation analysis conducted over four virtual scenarios within a regional horticultural AFSC proves how the AFSC-DT aids informed decision-making across the AFSC echelons, stimulating a virtuous cycle and favoring a progressive transition toward more sustainable patterns. © 2024 The Author(s)","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185554147"

To address this need, this work suggests that the incorporation of blockchain technology and Distributed Autonomous Organizations can be a disruptive approach to enhancing operational effectiveness, supply chain transparency, and data security in smart manufacturing. DAOs, made feasible by blockchain’s decentralized and transparent architecture, present a promising possibility for redefining cooperation and decision-making across stakeholders. The combination of the two generates a framework in which the inalterability and traceability of blockchain are used to guarantee supply chain transparency and data integrity, while the collective intelligence and democratic governance of DAOs are used to increase operational efficiency and sustainable practices. The proposed approach empowers stakeholders to participate in decision-making processes, fostering a collaborative ecosystem that optimizes resource allocation, minimizes waste, and promotes circular economy principles. By exploring real-world use cases and implementation strategies, this paper sheds light on the potential of block-DAO integration to address critical challenges in smart manufacturing, such as supply chain complexities, data silos, and environmental concerns. Additionally, it delves into the implications for data security and privacy, outlining robust mechanisms to safeguard sensitive information while maintaining transparency. Ultimately, this research paves the way for a sustainable and resilient smart manufacturing paradigm, where operational efficiency, supply chain transparency, and data security are seamlessly integrated through the synergistic combination of blockchain and DAO technologies. The proposed work provides a comprehensive guide for researchers, industry professionals, and policymakers seeking to leverage cutting-edge technologies for sustainable development in the manufacturing sector. The overview of the above real-world use cases and implementation strategies provides valuable insights into the possibility of block-DAO integration to address key challenges of smart manufacturing, including the complexity of supply chains, data silos, and environmental issues. Moreover, possible implications for data security and privacy and corresponding mechanisms to ensure protection and transparency are discussed. Thus, this research contributes to the creation of a stable and sustainable paradigm of smart manufacturing in the future, in which operational and supply chain aspects and data security are integrated through blockchain and DAO. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205963628"

From the individual station on a production line to the global supply chain, everything is connected, making regulation and control a complex task. Biological molecular processes, such as the metabolism of living organisms or the cell cycle, are also extremely complex processes that can be compared to industrial production processes, both of which involve a series of intermediate steps and products. Thanks to (self-)regulatory mechanisms that have evolved over time, these biological mechanisms are very efficient and robust in the face of perturbations. This article proposes an explanatory representation of these complex processes, considering both biological and technical aspects. The aim is to facilitate biomimetic transfer of biological regulation mechanisms into the technical domain. It presents concepts for biomimetic regulation of production lines and sourcing strategies and introduces a workflow for generating digital twins. This workflow is inspired by the cell cycle checkpoints, which ensure that only perfect copies of DNA are passed on during cell replication. By leveraging this understanding, the production industry can potentially improve its own processes and efficiency. © 2024 The Author(s).

In addition, improvements must encapsulate economic, environmental and social sustainability aspects. To address these needs, The New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research in 2021 initiated a series of programmes to develop a digital twin of a narrow-row planar cordon apple orchard. A digital twin would dynamically couple physical and biological components of apple production and its related supply chain systems with their virtual analogues. In this paper we describe the progress for one of the programmes, which is generating the physiological knowledge of a new high-yielding apple production system to subsequently develop and parameterise a functional-structural tree and a fruit model from tree to market. The programme has five research aims: 1) build a functional-structural apple tree model that will integrate our understanding of tree and fruit development in narrow-row planar cordon systems; 2) quantify tree architecture development and subsequently manipulate shoot architecture to optimise tree function and carbohydrate partitioning into fruit yield; 3) investigate energy capture, conversion and distribution within planar cordon apple trees; 4) develop new tools and methods to estimate parameters for modelling root growth and architecture and root function; 5) understand the on-orchard factors (e.g., light, crop load and temperature) that affect fruit growth and resulting firmness at harvest and during storage. Ultimately, the digital twin will guide interventions to improve productivity and quality, enhance resource and energy use efficiency, and reduce fruit waste throughout the production and supply chain. © 2024 International Society for Horticultural Science.

This paper presents a new Digital Twin framework to achieve robustness in manufacturing process optimization and enhance the efficiency of decision support. Most digital twins in the literature synchronously represent the real system without any control elements despite the bidirectional data link. The proposed approach combines the advantages of traditional process simulations with a real-time communication and data acquisition method using programmable logic controllers designed to control automated systems. In addition, it complements this by utilizing human experience and expertise in modeling using Fuzzy Logic to create a control-enabled digital twin system. The resulting ""Expert Twin"" system reduces the reaction time of the production to unexpected events and increases the efficiency of decision support; it generates and selects alternatives, therefore creating smart manufacturing. The Expert Twin framework was integrated, tested, and validated on an automated production sample system in a laboratory environment. In the experimental scenarios carried out, the method production increased production line utility by up to 28% and the number of re-schedules can be halved. © 2025 Regional Association for Security and crisis management.

A large number of concepts, tools, and methodologies have been proposed in support of this performance improvement. They are mainly based on the use of classical optimization or enterprise modeling methods. However, environmental and social issues, not to mention digital transformation, are often ignored or not sufficiently integrated. Indeed, the world geopolitical situation, the increase in oil prices, and the commitment to protect our earth require the integration of sustainability aspects and Industry 4.0 concepts like digital twin and artificial intelligence in transforming the supply chain. This paper focuses on defining a conceptual framework to support sustainable supply chain management and digital transformation. It aims to exploit the sustainability and digital maturity of companies to transform their supply chains and enhance their performance to meet the challenges of Industry 5.0. Several practices related to sustainability, as well as two use cases on optimization and digital twin, are presented to illustrate this framework. Finally, based on the previous practices and use cases, an adapted framework for the supply chain manager to support the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 has been developed, as well as a performance dashboard. © 2024 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203643881"

It aims to define this concept and identify the key hurdles that need to be overcome for its successful implementation. According to the six principles of sustainable development, the key pillar is remanufacturing. Remanufacturing helps the environment in several different ways, including: saving energy, the conservation of raw materials, the conservation of space, landfills, the reduction of air pollution, and greater fuel efficiency. This process closes the loop in the supply chain, exemplifying the principles of a circular economy. The research methods used are primarily the analysis and criticism of literature, document examination—especially in relation to existing simulation programs and analysis—the logical construction method, and the heuristic method, used to define concept of simulation modelling. In response to scientific and practical challenges, the concept of a new modeling method was defined and presented. This concept uses the legacy of Lean and the author’s original ideas regarding the structuring of the remanufacturing factory and processes. The main contribution of this study is integration, embedding this concept into the simulation software.

In combination, BIM and GIS underpin a location framework for Digital Twins across these applications. While traditionally relational databases have been used to integrate the data into one system, they face increasing limitations in handling the massive, complex BIM and 3DGIS data. This research investigates the potential of NoSQL databases as an alternative solution. Focusing on MongoDB, the study conducts a systematic performance comparison with the mature relational database, PostgreSQL. BIM and 3DGIS datasets from a live infrastructure construction project are utilised in three experiments assessing direct query, API-based retrieval, and 3D visualisation. The results provide valuable insights into MongoDB’s strengths in managing large spatial data via flexible schemas. However, limitations surface as data complexity and volume increases. Overall, this study concludes that NoSQL databases do offer some advantages for optimising BIM-3DGIS integration for seamless, combined, use, but more work is needed to fully harness their capabilities.

Originally aimed at product optimization and intelligent manufacturing, the range of applications for digital twins now spans entire complex, often highly interconnected systems such as ports, cities, and supply chains. Despite the increasing demand for sophisticated digital twinning solutions across all domains and scopes, their development is often still constrained by differing definitions, different understandings of their functional scope and design, and a lack of concrete methodology toward implementing a comprehensive digital twinning solution. Although there are already papers that evaluate the capabilities of existing digital twinning solutions on the basis of maturity levels, these usually consider the object to be twinned in isolation and are often domain-specific. With this article we address exactly this gap discussing how interoperability of digital twins can break physical boundaries of an isolated system, enabling system of systems joint optimization. We therefore consider interoperable digital twins to be the most mature twinning platforms, thus, we discuss in detail six digital twin maturity levels, departing from the interrelated contexts of ports, cities, and supply chains. Examples drawn from these domains demonstrate the need for interoperability toward optimizing processes and systems in realistic contexts, rather than in assumed isolation.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181555264"

Conclusions: Our research findings confirm several recommendations. First, the machine learning-based model identifies new areas that are not addressed in the human review results. Second, while the human review results put more emphasis on practicality, such as management activities, processes, and methods, the machine learning results pay more attention to macro perspectives, such as infrastructure, technology, and business.

Further, as the concept of Industry 5.0 emphasizes, the increasing mass customization production makes the product configurations full of individuation and diversification. Driven by these fundamental changes, the design for sustainability of a high-mix low-volume product–service system faces the increasingly deep coupling of technology-driven product solutions and value-driven human-centric goals. The multi-criteria decision making of sustainability issues is prone to fall into the complex, contradictory, fragmented, and opaque flood of information. To this end, this work presents a data-driven quantitative method for the sustainability assessment of product–service systems by integrating analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods to measure the sustainability of customized products and promote the Industry 5.0-enabled sustainable product–service system practice. This method translates the sustainability assessment into a multi-criteria decision-making problem, to find the solution that meets the most important criteria while minimizing trade-offs between conflicting criteria, such as individual preferences or needs and the life cycle sustainability of bespoke products. In the future, the presented method can extend to cover more concerns of Industry 5.0, such as digital-twin-driven recyclability and disassembly of customized products, and the overall sustainability and resilience of the supply chain. © 2024 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189160564"

In the process of writing this chapter, several innovative and patented technical solutions in a general subject area were analyzed and systemized. Using the method of heuristic design from the perspective of a timely and effective dual transition of the maritime industry, modified added value chains and separate concepts and solutions were identified and proposed. Analogies were also used to develop practical structures of appropriate monitoring and control systems since using AI instruments to optimize dual transition task solutions is relatively efficiently solved in other industries, namely in communication, automotive, robotics, healthcare industries, etc. The concept of ""multivariate control of a multifunctional ship fleet"" based on the advantages of polymetric sensors utilization and edge and cloud computing hybridization is described concisely, somewhat limited by the number of case studies conducted, but in a meaningful and structured way as a result of the research. © 2024 River Publishers.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202985709"

With increasing digital technology and green transition efforts under the scope of twin transformation, demand for CRMs has increased, and supply interruption is expected in the future. All countries should plan the supply chain of CRMs in the context of the green and digital transition. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) have presented a reference based on sustainability metrics. In the chapter, hesitant-fuzzy analytical hierarchy process-based order preference technique based on similarity to ideal solutions (HF-AHP based TOPSIS) has been developed to evaluate the critical raw materials in the context of sustainability. Most relevant goals with the CRMs are obtained as SDG 1, SDG 3, SDG 5, SDG 6, SDG 7, SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 11, SDG 17. The findings show how raw materials have important strengths and weaknesses in sustainable development. Policies recommended for the most important CRMs are effective road maps in the context of twin transformation. © 2024, IGI Global.

Still, the sequential nature of off-site production, encompassing casting, curing, and storage of the precast elements, is subject to significant uncertainties, including supply chain variability and environmental factors affecting curing times. Dynamic adjustments to the production schedule are essential for aligning with real-time changes, necessitating a robust framework for real-time data acquisition and analysis. Dynamic Scheduling (DS) is a responsive and adaptive approach that accommodates real-time changes, optimizes the production flow, and minimizes downtime or delays. However, the DS approach demands real-time data to quickly and efficiently respond to unforeseen challenges, which requires acquiring and analyzing production-relevant data throughout the production process. The Digital Twin (DT) emerges in Industry 4.0 (I4.0) as a bridge between physical operations and digital capabilities, enabling a seamless flow of information, for which the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) is a reference implementation. This study introduces a DS framework to optimize precast element production, utilizing a DT for real-time data aggregation across the production system. The framework implements a Semantic DT based on the AAS and the Linked Data approach. It employs Resource Description Framework (RDF) serialization of the AAS and an ontological representation of the production system for data integration. The framework leverages a simulation-based scheduler, which exchanges data with the DT in a Service-oriented Architecture (SoA) using SPARQL, a language for querying and updating graph databases. The approach is evaluated through a proof of concept, demonstrating effective uncertainty management in a dynamic production environment. © 2024 The Authors","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198289575"

Studies showed that businesses and manufacturing industries suffer from cyber-attacks, especially after the emergence of Industry 4.0 and IoT devices connected to the cloud for data sharing purposes, these interactions between IoT devices and the information involved in the transactions between companies and customers produce a massive amount of data daily. This phenomenon becomes an easy target for attackers due to the security limitations, data corruption and compromised reliability of the traditional manufacturing systems during data transferring. Many have focused on the methods to address these security limitations of the manufacturing businesses. This paper shed the light on the major smart manufacturing sectors that can potentially benefit from blockchain technologies, including cloud manufacturing, collaborative manufacturing, digital twin manufacturing, robonomics based smart manufacturing and the supply chain industry. The blockchain can enhance the security by creating a decentralized environment for the data to be stored, which will make the data stored immutable for improved security. These immutable data are nearly impossible to manipulate, replace, or falsify the data stored on the blockchain secured network. © 2024, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Conventionally, optimizing dispatch involves establishing odds distribution functions for renewables and the linked load model. Despite numerous modeling approaches, few consider customer approval, often relying on complex parameter-solving algorithms. This paper introduces an ideal deployment strategy for a thermoelectric-coupled MG to tackle these issues. Utilizing a digital twin framework that incorporates thermoelectric technology and Renewable Energy Resources (RERs), the study employs a Modified Biogeography Enhancement Algorithm (MBOA) for effective economic dispatch. Initially, a parameter simplification method is anticipated to address RE uncertainty, incorporating normal distribution odds functions and reserve capability allocation prices. Additionally, the paper takes into account the impact of transferable and reducible loads on customer approval for request side response, considering the load tracking capability on renewables. An enhanced biogeography-driven enhancement algorithm is presented to optimize the anticipated system. Computer simulations and comparisons validate the efficiency of the strategy in dropping the MG's functioning prices, emphasizing the importance of sustainable energy management practices that integrate waste heat recovery and renewable resources in contemporary power systems. © 2024","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185829795"

The proposed hybrid digital twin sensitivity analysis method used in this study integrates clustering, machine learning, a cloud model, and the Monte Carlo simulation method. The contributions of the study are as follows: (1) the discovered factors strengthen the theoretical basis of the sustainable transition; (2) the proposed hybrid method reveals compound interrelationships by utilizing insufficient data; and (3) these compound interrelationships are presented in a visual diagram to provide guidelines for allocating resources to promote the sustainable transition.

Addressing waste management challenges in this sector is crucial to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated approach for modeling sustainable waste flow management in the fashion supply chain and consequently contributes to reducing the associated environmental impact. Firstly, Waste Flow Mapping (WFM) assessment is used to identify waste production at each stage of the fashion supply chain. Secondly, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used to quantify environmental impact on resource consumption, waste generation, energy usage, and emissions. Finally, performance metrics and sustainability reporting are established to monitor and track environmental performance. Results show: i) a 25–30% reduction in environmental impacts across product life cycles, ii) a 20–25% improvement in resource efficiency iii) an increase of 15–20% in product's life extensions, and iv) approximately 40–50% of materials can be originated from recycled sources.

Digital supply chain twins have been proposed in order to provide decision makers with an effective and efficient tool to mitigate disruption impact. This paper introduces a hybrid deep learning approach for disruption detection within a cognitive digital supply chain twin framework to enhance supply chain resilience. The proposed disruption detection module utilises a deep autoencoder neural network combined with a one-class support vector machine algorithm. In addition, long-short term memory neural network models are developed to identify the disrupted echelon and predict time-to-recovery from the disruption effect. The obtained information from the proposed approach will help decision-makers and supply chain practitioners make appropriate decisions aiming at minimizing negative impact of disruptive events based on real-time disruption detection data. The results demonstrate the trade-off between disruption detection model sensitivity, encountered delay in disruption detection, and false alarms.

Digital twins of customer demands promise to remedy these issues. However, successful implementation necessitates users' technology acceptance. This study contrasts three hierarchical digital twin levels with different degrees of user integration and examines determinants for their respective acceptance. Design/methodology/approach: A structural equation model is applied in a comparative manner, considering different levels of digital twin radicalness. A multidimensional approach is used to measure attitudes towards usage. Data are collected in the context of organisational supply management. Findings: Results show harmonious effects across digital twin levels. This indicates that technological radicality plays only a subordinate role when assessing acceptance determinants such as user perception on ease of use, usefulness, trust and risk. Practical implications: Rather than focussing solely on technological factors, findings suggest that users prioritise the actual outcome and efficiency of the system. This perspective offers practical implications for organisations seeking to implement advanced systems and emphasises the significance of user perceptions beyond technological features. Social implications: The societal impact of this research are an appreciation of customer roles in the supply chain where an enhanced detection of customer needs and preferences aligns businesses with the dynamic and evolving demands of a diverse and a continuously environmentally-conscious consumer base. Originality/value: This study applies a measurement model for technology acceptance in a unique and multidimensional manner. Thereby, a comparative analysis of user perceptions across different digital twin levels sheds more light on a nascent, promising and underexplored technological method. This interdisciplinary research combined knowledge from the supply chain management and management information systems fields by highlighting key factors for the adoption of complex technological methods. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180481894"

Since 2017, the use of Digital Twins has been increasing. However, in the road transport and logistics realm, the adoption rate remains low, primarily due to the costs of processing and validating data in centralised scenarios, among other factors. On the other hand, Blockchain technologies were created to provide immutable and decentralised data storage in diverse scenarios, adding a layer of isolation and reliability in heterogeneous solutions.

This work presents the framework of an information system for implementing Resilient Manufacturing value chains. The objective is to achieve resilience by applying the framework which leverages on data space technology, such as Gaia-X or International Data Space (IDS), and the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), where AAS supports the implementation of Digital Twins.

Visualization techniques, including dashboards, are generally attributed to the effectiveness of a digital twin. Though dashboard engineering has attracted a great deal of attention in the last decade, it has been hampered by a lack of automation tools, leading to poorly designed dashboards that fail to grasp the analyst’s analytical context. We develop a tool that semi-automatically creates a contextual dashboard that proves useful in the digital twin of a business process. Technically, our tool generates such a dashboard by iterating through all the pools and data objects visually depicted in a business process and generating the computer-interpretable source code that represents the appropriate visualization charts.

Having been very hesitant about this change for a long time, and now that in some countries politicians have also increased their environmental goals, grid operators and municipal utilities must prepare themselves. In order to get electric vehicles and heat pumps into the grid in significantly larger numbers in a timely manner, there needs to be an acceleration and digitalization in the approval processes, but also a connection of the entire supply chain and IT processes that are still separate today. There will not be more personnel. The conversion will cost money, so expansion costs should be reduced by using measurements and digital twins to simulate and control the grid. However, this requires distribution network operators, smart gateway administrators, and charging point operators to talk to each other and coordinate their efforts. In addition, there is a need for an adapted regulatory framework that provides appropriate incentives not only for hardware, but also finally for software and services. The EU Green Deal addresses the issues of CO2, climate neutrality and circular economy. This is a requirement that the energy sector must meet.

A better understanding of when and where food quality is lost in these supply chains provides opportunities to reduce the quality variability within and between different shipments. Nowadays, however, only a few (hygro-)thermal sensors are placed within every shipment, which masks the variability in the shipment. These hygrothermal data are also not actionable for stakeholders for decision-making. The resulting food quality evolution and its variability within a shipment remain invisible. We approach this problem by building a validated physics-based digital model of a refrigerated container for citrus fruit. This virtual container model is described extensively in an accompanying paper (Defraeye et al., 2024). We use computational fluid dynamics with a two-phase porous media approach to simulate the airflow in this virtual container. We also simulate the cooling process of every single fruit and the fruit's thermal quality loss. We compare the virtual container model with a full-scale experimental data set. The simulations captured the main physical trends of container cooling but cooled on average 0.3 d faster. The variability in seven-eighths cooling time within the cargo was over 2 days, and that of the remaining shelf life after the transport period of 24 days was about 0.7 days. We identify the slowest cooling location in the cargo. This location is the pallet or box that would need to be inspected to assess the quality or the best location to place the sensors. The model simulations indicate that during the container's warm loading or hot stuffing, high airflow rates should be used for the first three days to improve fruit quality preservation. Lower airflow rates can be used later on. The simulations show that airflow bypasses through gaps between pallets should be avoided. Using a void plug can decrease the cooling time by 30%. Void plug placement is found to be much more effective than reducing the small gaps between the pallets. The type of void plug that is used is less critical. Cooling and quality problems could be mitigated by placing precooled pallets at the expected slowest cooling locations in the container. Changing the T-bar floor height, while keeping the pallet height constant, affected the differences in cooling and quality between both sides of the container. The virtual container provides a full spatiotemporal map of the fruit temperature, temperature-driven quality, and postharvest life for all fruit in the container. We quantified cooling times and remaining shelf life in 60,000 individual probe locations. The data that are engineered by the virtual container is currently a missing link to enable in-transit temperature management, shelf-life-driven logistics, and inventory management. The virtual container is also an essential building block of a refrigerated container's digital twin that can help reduce food loss and increase supply-chain resilience. Such simulation tools will support stakeholders in the future in evaluating and improving cargo temperature control and resulting fruit quality at arrival. © 2024 The Authors","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185335923"

In the FBA-CPO network, each charger records all transactions on a local ledger and publicly publishes ledgers through random UD nodes. Under a generalization of the property of the federated quorum system, the proposed approach could provide a reliable network centrality with or without offline EVSEs. Eventually, we examined the performance of the proposed model using a system of real devices and their digital twins. Results show the FBA-CPO satisfies all functional and cross-cutting requirements for a consistent transnational mechanism.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168719715"

Due to the high complexity of these systems, simulation approaches can be used to generate accurate performance measures for a specific system configuration. Simulation models are also the cornerstone of digital twins, one of the latest technological innovations that can further improve warehouse operations. Therefore, the aim of this research is to describe an approach for the development of a discrete event simulation model of an automated storage and retrieval system with a perspective towards the implementation of a digital twin. To be consistent with the objectives of the digital twin, the proposed model represents both the physical system and the overarching information technology architecture, such as the warehouse management system and the warehouse control system. In addition, this paper describes a methodology to validate such a simulation model by setting up an experimental campaign based on the principles of design of experiment. The experiments conducted in a logistics laboratory were used to iteratively calibrate the model until its performance accurately reflected the functioning of the real system. The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, this work contributes to the literature on warehouse digital twins by highlighting new variables to be considered when defining travel time models and their stochastic nature. © The Author(s) 2023. corrected publication 2023.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177689267"

There is growing evidence that investment in digital twin technology is becoming crucial for improving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings and mitigating risks within a sustainable semiconductor supply chain. Nonetheless, how fairness concerns impact the decision-making processes among different stakeholders remains inadequately understood. This paper presents an analytical analysis of the dynamic strategic interplay among semiconductor manufacturers, consumers, and government regulatory agencies (GRAs) utilizing the evolutionary game model. The aim is to investigate how long-term ESG strategies and fairness-oriented behaviors respond to government incentives. The findings imply that substantial investment demands can dissuade semiconductor manufacturers from delivering ESG services, while low tax rates may lead to their complacency and a subsequent lack of investment in ESG initiatives. Meanwhile, semiconductor manufacturers are more inclined to provide ESG services when the order loss ratio is low, and the tax rate is high, with strict regulations further amplifying this probability. Furthermore, consumers valuing fairness and equity tend to give positive feedback for basic services but is critical of ESG services due to issues with transparency in digital twin technologies. Addressing these issues extends beyond the scope of market incentives alone, requiring interventions from third parties such as government regulations, policy incentives, and enhanced data security measures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201146898"

Circular and digital transformations require a paradigm shift, which depends on professional skills that translate emerging challenges into economic, social, and environmental advantages. However, prior research has offered limited contributions to skills and competences needed for enabling CE transition considering the parallel digital transformation of sociotechnical systems. To address this gap, this study relies on a systematic literature review to clarify which professional skills are fundamental for a successful twin transition in the manufacturing sector. As a result, 40 skills have been identified, categorized into three dimensions: (1) Resilience skills, (2) Digital technologies skills, and (3) Specialized/Technical skills. The findings reveal the multidisciplinary nature of the skills, which should be combined to reach circularity goals. Overall, this study enhances the understanding of critical skills, enabling academics and training providers to better structure courses and curricula that meet current market requirements.

To ensure energy security, the coal-fired power plant will remain an important support for electricity supply security and the integration of renewable energy for a considerable period into the future in China. To achieve carbon neutrality, the energy system is gradually shifting from primarily relying on fossil fuels to primarily relying on renewable energy. However, the intermittency, randomness, and volatility of renewable energy make power system regulation more challenging, highlighting the issues of system balance and security. In this context, the zero-carbon fuels such as ammonia play an indispensable role in dealing with the intermittency of renewable energy. They can serve as carriers for long-term and large-scale energy storage to facilitate the large-scale integration of renewable energy and can also be flexibly used directly in power equipment such as boilers to replace fossil fuels. However, due to the differences in physical and chemical properties between zero-carbon fuels and fossil fuels, some challenges arise in the widespread utilization of ammonia fuel, such as poor flame stability and the generation of nitrogen oxides during combustion. Therefore, based on the feasibility, economy and necessity of ammoniac-coal co-combustion, this paper comprehensively reviews the chemical reaction kinetics, combustion characteristics (ignition, steady combustion) and pollutants characteristics (NOx, fly ash particles and soot) of ammoniac-coal co-combustion, and discusses the scaling laws of burner based on the dimensionless number. The efficient and stable combustion control strategy of existing industrial grade ammonia-coal burners is discussed in detail. The C—N fuel separation, air staged and their joint control technology can effectively reduce NOx emissions. In the future, artificial intelligence, big data and digital twin and other information technologies are integrated. It is expected to provide a scientific support and path reference for the research and development of the next generation of new green power generation system oriented to the dual carbon strategy from the source. © 2024 China Coal Society.

Thus, academic and scientific communities now view global food security as a critical issue. However, food loss and waste are a major challenge when adopting food security and sustainability strategies, since a large proportion of food is lost or wasted along the food supply chain. In order to use resources efficiently and enhance food security and sustainability, food waste and by-products must be reduced and properly valorized. Plant-based food production generates various by-products which are generally rich in nutrients and bioactive compounds. Emerging technologies have been effectively employed to extract these valuable compounds with health benefits. Recently, Industry 4.0 technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, blockchain, robotics, smart sensors, 3D printing, and digital twins have a great deal of potential for waste reduction and by-products valorization in food industry. Reducing food waste not only benefits the environment, but also reduces greenhouse gas emissions and thus contributes to sustainable resource management. This review provides up-to-date information on the potential of Industry 4.0 for converting plant-based waste and by-products into valuable products. Recent studies showed that innovations in Industry 4.0 provide attractive opportunities to increase the effectiveness of manufacturing operations and improve food quality, safety and traceability. By leveraging Food Industry 4.0, companies can transform plant-based waste and by-products into valuable products and contribute to a more sustainable and efficient food production system. © 2024 The Authors","39414050","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206617279"

Agro-food supply chain (AFSC) is one of the most important supply chains that can be made more efficient by widespread adoption of DT. However, the adoption and implementation of DT in AFSC is very limited due to various hindrances. Thus, it is imperative to identify and analyze the DT barriers thoroughly; and subsequently, develop strategies to overcome the dominant barriers for the successful implementation of DT in AFSC. This study identifies the barriers to DT implementation through a literature review and experts’ opinions. The interaction amongst the barriers is captured using the “Weighted Influence Non-linear Gauge System (WINGS)” method. Lack of technology infrastructure, technology immaturity, and high capital investment emerge as the dominant causal barriers. Furthermore, to overcome the identified barriers, a framework based on a triple helix approach is suggested. The findings of the study will be useful for government agencies, policymakers, agricultural institutions, and agro-food industry stakeholders to eliminate the obstacles to the successful implementation of DT in AFSC. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186855823"

The growth of productivity of goods and services is directly related to the economy. Manpower, machinery, tools, and costs have drastically improved according to the developing technologies. The term Industry 5.0 refers to a scenario where people make use of advanced technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, and smart machines for effective productivity. This development is more advantageous like providing low-cost products, improved wages, and transportation of goods from rural to urban areas. Since industries are dependent on smart devices, and automated environments, energy consumption and data privacy have become a challenge nowadays. To resolve these issues, blockchain technology provides a decentralized network where the information and transactions are encrypted and stored as blocks. Each block undergoes data validation through the mining process and gets added to the chain of blocks as a blockchain. This is a distributed ledger where a copy of a transaction is distributed across the network to maintain data transparency and immutability. Supply chain management, digital twinning, and secure data exchange among the stakeholders are some of the applications of blockchain in Industries 5.0. This enhances traceability, transparency, and quality control in the supply chain because of its tamper-proof property. Every transaction is securely recorded in the form of smart contracts which automate contracts that increase the efficiency of the system from malicious attacks. Digital twinning is another concept where a digital replica of the physical world is created and data are updated and synchronized accordingly. Thus, the implementation of blockchain technology in Industry 5.0 guarantees data security and privacy, which builds confidence among industrialists and increases efficiency. © 2024 Scrivener Publishing LLC.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206666442"

The proposal for implementing the enabling industry 5.0 application was presented to the chief engineers of eight distinct fan manufacturers. Out of these, five responded positively and their feedback was subsequently followed up on. Three different avenues such as production, supply chain, and testing transparency were proposed for industry 5.0 implementation. The exploration of testing transparency is being undertaken based on a consensual decision. The Web of Things standard that enables digital twin generation in industry 4.0 is implemented to enable the testing transparency. This data was linked with the internal digital twin of fan motor created using ANSYS.

Physical entities can be converted into digital twins with smart IoT (Internet of Things) devices and computational techniques. Research efforts have generally focused on the development of digital twin models for basic practical applications. Advanced applications of digital twins have not been widely reported. An innovative use of digital twins for inventory management has only been analysed theoretically and reported as meta-inventory management for the first time by Wang and Huang (2023). This paper extends the novel concept of meta-inventory by using a theoretical Newsvendor model for original equipment manufacturing (OEM) and own brand manufacturing (OBM) factories. The impacts of meta-inventory on both supply chain members, including the factory and its downstream retailer, are investigated through two kinds of response models (e.g., hybrid and separate response models). Analytical and numerical results show that a factory achieves better performance by using a separate model since it clarifies the responsibility of digital twins. The hybrid response model holds a higher proportion of digital inventory, but its final profits are less than that in the separate model due to fewer orders and higher prices and costs of uncertainty. OBM can better leverage the advantage of digital twins than OEM. Also, both supply chain members benefit from the implementation of meta-inventory out of profit increase, price reduction, and risk hedging. This research provides guidance for manufacturing sites to implement digital twins and reduce their concerns on investing in meta-inventory. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199128890"

PS, mainly known for its horizontal effects within the operational decision level, directly impacts both tactical and strategical levels of decision-making. In other words, an optimally designed and utilized PS module could bring efficiency towards the whole supply chain network of many manufacturing systems. Simulation Optimization (SO), as a growing Decision Support Tool (DST), provides a methodology required to drastically improve the efficiency of industrial systems. Thus, in this article, we review the existing research on SO Applied to PS (SOAPS), within the context of wider adaption of Industry 4.0 (known as the fourth industrial revolution). Firstly, relevant articles are examined and reviewed to position the research and develop research questions that enable the highlighting of research gaps. Then, a methodology was created based on: the studied PS problem features, proposed optimization frameworks, executed simulation tools, the SO architectures and the experimentation and validation strategies used. Finally, we investigate how Industry 4.0 could enhance the existing research on SOAPS to provide real-time and efficient SO-based DSTs for PS modules within modern manufacturing systems. © 2024 The Author(s)","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188026764"

However, the integration of BIM into 3D GIS tools is becoming more common, showing progress beyond the traditional problem. To address this, this study proposes data transformation methods involving mapping between three domains: industry foundation classes (IFC), city geometry markup language (CityGML), and web ontology framework (OWL)/resource description framework (RDF). Initially, IFC data are converted to CityGML format using the feature manipulation engine (FME) at CityGML standard’s levels of detail 4 (LOD4) to enhance BIM data interoperability. Subsequently, CityGML is converted to the OWL/RDF diagram format to validate the proposed BIM conversion process. To ensure integration between BIM and GIS, geometric data and information are visualized through Cesium Ion web services and Unreal Engine. Additionally, an RDF graph is applied to analyze the association between the semantic mapping of the CityGML standard, with Neo4j (a graph database management system) utilized for visualization. The study’s results demonstrate that the proposed data transformation methods significantly improve the interoperability and visualization of 3D city models, facilitating better urban management and planning. © 2024 by the authors.","38931546","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197158933"

However, repeating the successful off-site construction projects to scale the benefits can be challenging considering that construction projects vary across regions and contexts. The streamlined processes and a consistent collection of information requirements should be leveraged to alleviate the challenge and help stakeholders effectively adopt the off-site construction approach. To achieve this goal, this study defines the information requirements across multiple stages of the off-site construction supply chain, using the case study approach to delineate the information requirements for an off-site construction company located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The evaluation and interpretation of the case study underscore the need for consistent collection, storage and utilization of logistics, construction, and postconstruction activities information to tie back to sales and design activities. To facilitate the activities integration, an information requirement framework is proposed for off-site construction processes based on the learnings collected from the case study and a digital twin technology platform. Although the reuse and interoperability of information among various systems remains a long-standing issue to prevent the wide adoption of off-site construction, the findings and the proposed information requirement framework can be an integral part of the potential guidelines for successful implementation of off-site construction. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205004371"

The Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture has brought sensors and networked technology to gather and analyse environmental and crop data, enabling precision farming that optimises resource usage and increases yields. Yet, current agricultural methods suffer from unsecured and decentralised data management, causing inefficiencies and complicating traceability across the supply chain. The integration of IoT with blockchain technology is seen as a promising solution to enhance data-driven agriculture. Blockchain provides a secure, decentralised, and transparent ledger that enhances data integrity, reduces fraud, and improves traceability, which complements IoT applications. The authors detail the development of an innovative system that orchestrates IoT and blockchain technologies to facilitate the adoption of new technologies in agriculture and overcomes the lacked of comprehensive data connectivity. It outlines a conceptual framework and its preliminary empirical implementation. The system consists of three integrated layers: the IoT layer, which creates digital twins of field crops; the blockchain layer, which secures and manages data from the field and external stakeholders for dynamic applications such as track and tracing; and the orchestration layer, which fuses physical and digital data to optimise business models, enhance supply chain productivity, and support governmental policy-making, thereby improving field productivity and food sector innovation. © 2024 The Author(s).

To facilitate the adoption and integration of DT technologies in livestock farming systems, this study aims to discern and appraise the most recent advancements by assessing scientific and technological progressions. The objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive review of the literature to determine the status of DT application in livestock farm management with its benefits, challenges, and prospects. Scientific databases, PRISMA guidelines, and systematic bibliometric methodologies were used for searching and sorting the most fit articles. This study found that DT technology is new to the livestock industry and mainly used for environmental control, feed management, farm planning, greenhouse gas reduction, and behavior monitoring. Key barriers to DT deployment include high establishment costs, risk of market monopolization, and technical knowledge gaps. The amalgamation of government subsidies, localized technology production, and the provision of training facilities can be instrumental in enabling farmers to overcome the obstacles. The application of DT is limited in monitoring animal behavior and farm environment. However, DT technology has the potential for broader use, such as predicting growth, feed consumption, and improving the supply chain. Although these new areas are yet to be explored in real farm conditions. Along with expanding the new area of using DT in livestock farm management, future collaborative research should concentrate on creating new machine learning and/or deep learning models. © 2024 by the authors.

This method is used to assess and quantify the contribution of individual organizations, products, or processes to the global climate. The environmental impact of processing throughout its life cycle is evaluated by a comprehensive method known as life cycle assessment. Sustainability criteria assessment and utilization of sustainability indicators are important to conduct circularity in research. Effective food supply chain management plays an essential role in achieving sustainability goals and increasing food safety. Scope and approach: The present review highlights the evaluation of carbon footprint by methods such as nonthermal techniques, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Artificial intelligence and machine learning include the use of electronic sensors, digital twin technology, and the current version system to evaluate the quality and organoleptic conditions. These methods result in optimizing energy and resource consumption and promote sustainability. Key findings and conclusion: This review emphasizes that nonthermal processing technologies and artificial intelligence demonstrate significant potential in reducing energy use, water consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions, thereby contributing to the sustainability goals of the circular bioeconomy. Furthermore, AI-driven technologies offer promising solutions for monitoring agricultural outputs, optimizing supply chains, and reducing waste. Therefore, adopting these technologies within the framework of the circular bioeconomy not only offers a viable pathway toward a more sustainable food system but also aligns with global sustainability objectives by promoting resource efficiency and reducing waste. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193732932"

However, the analysis of scientific literature reveals that further efforts are needed to spread the use of Industry 4.0 technologies, in the specific context of Internal Supply Chains (ISCs). The main aim of this study is to design, develop test and validate a multi-plant Simulation-Based DT production planning platform for ISCs management. A modular architecture is adopted, and the focus is on a Simulation-Based Digital Twin module, which uses an object-oriented structure and enables what-if analyses, involving several scheduling rules and ISC configurations. The proposed solution ensures flexibility and scalability, two crucial features in a constantly evolving market environment. The platform is tested and validated through a case study, involving a corporate group in the Oil & Gas manufacturing sector, which needs to improve the ISC performance, under a Make-To-Order production strategy. The comparison with a baseline scenario, where the platform is not adopted, shows that the proposed approach can significantly reduce the average flow time, the average tardiness, the number of late orders.

This study aims to systematically review the literature on the use of simulation tools in managing supply chain disruptions, focusing on the historical evolution, prevalent simulation methods, specific challenges addressed, and research gaps. A systematic literature review was conducted using the PRISMA method. An initial pool of 236 articles was identified, from which 213 publications were rigorously reviewed. This study analyzed these articles to map the academic landscape, identify key clusters, and explore the integration of digital advancements in enhancing supply chain resilience. The review identified the chronological development of research in this field, highlighting significant contributions and influential authors. It was found that various simulation methods, including discrete-event simulation, agent-based modeling, and system dynamics, are employed to address different aspects of supply chain disruptions. Two primary research frontiers emerged from the analysis: the strategic reconfiguration of supply chain networks to mitigate ripple effects and the swift implementation of countermeasures to contain disruptions. The findings suggest a need for future research focusing on dynamic analysis and control theory applications to understand and manage supply chain disruptions better. This study also notes the increasing interest and need to use digital technologies (digital twins, artificial intelligence, etc.) in future research. It underscores the necessity for continued research to develop resilient and sustainable supply chain infrastructures aligned with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.

The continuous increase in the global demand for energy indicates that the urban gas industry plays a crucial role in terms of stability, the economy, and the environmental friendliness of the energy supply. However, price volatility, supply chain complexity, and strengthened environmental regulations are certain challenges faced by this industry. In this study, we intend to overcome these challenges by elucidating the application of digital twin technology and by improving the performance of the prediction models in the gas industry. The real-time data and simulation-based predictions of pressure fluctuations were integrated in terms of pressure control equipment. We determined the contribution of this data integration to enhancing the operational efficiency, safety, and sustainable development in the gas industry. The summary of the results highlights the superior predictive performance of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. It exhibited the best performance across all evaluation indices—mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination (R2)—when compared with the raw data. Specifically, the ARIMA model demonstrated the lowest RMSE value of 0.01575, the lowest MAPE value of 0.00609, and the highest R2 value of 0.94993 among the models evaluated. This indicates that the ARIMA model outperformed the other models in accurately predicting the outcomes. These findings validate that the integration of digital twin technology and prediction models can innovatively improve the maintenance strategy, operational efficiency, and risk prediction in the gas industry. Predictive maintenance models can help prevent significant industrial risks, such as gas leak accidents. Moreover, the integration of digital twin technology and predictive maintenance models can significantly enhance the safety and sustainability in the gas industry. The proposed innovative method of implementing digital twin technology and improved prediction models lays a theoretical foundation for sustainable development that can be applied to other industries with high energy consumption. © 2024 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199667973"

The literature offers some contributions to proactive indicators to assess the resilience of a system before a disruption occurs. Other studies provide metrics to assess resilience from the reactive perspective after the onset or end of a disruption. This paper examines the application of some proactive indicators from network science to some post-disruption measure of resilience, especially how these measure evolves as a function of time. We examine this by testing different supply chain designs against disrupted scenarios and using data from a real-life industry. The focus is on service level as a performance metric. The tested indicators correlate well with performance loss but show a limited ability to correlate with metrics representing SC dynamics. The practical contribution of this paper is an approach to measure SC resilience as an inherent property of the system, which can aid in designing future SCs, rather than measuring resilience as a response to a disruptive event. The paper also provides theoretical contributions, including the further validation of certain indicators from the literature and the identification of research areas in need of new metrics.

The study aims to understand how the characteristics of Italian districts influence the choices related to the twin transition and how it affects textile industrial firms. Design/methodology/approach: The author conducts a multiple-case study involving five firms of industrial textile district of Prato. Findings: The results show the relationship between the characteristics of the district, such as fragmentation of the supply chain, lean manufacturing, territorial proximity and attachment to origins and traditions and the sustainable goals and I4.0 technologies adoption. Moreover, the study proposes a framework for twin transition. Market and technology drive the process in which sustainability represents the aim, I4.0 serves as enablers and the relevant outcome is the implementation of the business model innovation. Practical implications: These findings offer valuable insights for textile firms, policymakers and stakeholders seeking to navigate the complexities of twin transition. Originality/value: The study contributes to the broader topic of twin transition. In particular, it links the particular context represented by the industrial district in which the textile firms operate to their conduct, and the two interconnected and distinct processes, sustainable transition and digital transition, with the business model innovation topic. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195846098"

This has led to the development and commercialization of Digital Twin (DT) technology. The widespread adoption of DT has resulted in a new network paradigm called Digital Twin Networks (DTNs), which orchestrate through the networks of ubiquitous DTs and their corresponding physical assets. DTNs create virtual twins of physical objects via DT technology and realize the co-evolution between physical and virtual spaces through data processing, computing, and DT modeling. The high volume of user data and the ubiquitous communication systems in DTNs come with their own set of challenges. The most serious issue here is with respect to user data privacy and security because users of most applications are unaware of the data that they are sharing with these platforms and are naive in understanding the implications of the data breaches. Also, currently, there is not enough literature that focuses on privacy and security issues in DTN applications. In this survey, we first provide a clear idea of the components of DTNs and the common metrics used in literature to assess their performance. Next, we offer a standard network model that applies to most DTN applications to provide a better understanding of DTN's complex and interleaved communications and the respective components. We then shed light on the common applications where DTNs have been adapted heavily and the privacy and security issues arising from the DTNs. We also provide different privacy and security countermeasures to address the previously mentioned issues in DTNs and list some state-of-the-art tools to mitigate the issues. Finally, we provide some open research issues and problems in the field of DTN privacy and security. © 2024 The Author(s)","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207016191"

Faced with rising preferences for personalized goods, convenience, and price competitiveness, many companies pivot towards e-commerce strategies and product family approaches to offer wider product varieties and shorten delivery times. This is evident in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry, where multi-echelon networks are often utilized to optimize inventory and lower costs. While these methods can fulfill consumer expectations, decreased network resilience is a key obstacle, leaving supply networks vulnerable to supply and demand disruptions. Hence, a holistic approach is required to mitigate disruptions impacts in multi-echelon networks. As a digital enabler, digital twin (DT) technology can manage disruptions in SC networks and manufacturing shop floors. However, these solutions typically operate in silos without context considerations, resulting in illogical solutions. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a novel supply and production (S&P) DT system to enhance resilience and disruption management in multi-echelon networks. A four-tier technology stack is introduced first, then resilience evaluation, SC replanning, and shop floor rescheduling methods are explored. Based on this, a DT-enabled disruption mitigation mechanism is proposed and featured in an F&B-oriented demand spike disruption case study. Results show the role of the hybrid S&P DT system in improving demand fulfillment rate and reducing production make span to enhance operational continuity. © 2024","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193008229"

Over the last decade, data-driven approaches like machine learning (ML) have also gained prominence in SCM, employing methods such as supervised learning (SL), unsupervised learning (UL), and reinforcement learning (RL). As supply chains grow in complexity, hybrid models combining simulation (Sim) and ML are becoming increasingly common, and the field stands to gain from a structured review of this literature. Towards this, we developed the Sim-ML Literature Classification Framework, which includes a hierarchical taxonomy comprising five SC criteria, 22 Sim-ML classes and over 75 Sim-ML subclasses. We applied this framework to synthesize 99 papers, revealing significant diversity in how Sim-ML models are used to address supply chain challenges. Key findings include the recognition of the breadth of study objectives, identifying various forms of model hybridization achieved by combining discrete/continuous simulation techniques with SL, UL, and RL approaches, and the data flow mechanisms such as sequential and feedback methods employed by the simulation and ML elements of the hybrid model. Our findings also identify some gaps in the literature; for example, optimization is rarely incorporated into Sim-ML models. Also, most studies present Sim-ML models for addressing problems in general supply chains, likely due to the lack of access to industrial data. The review also highlights that Industry 4.0 technologies, such as digital twins and blockchain, are underrepresented in current research, as are topics like sustainability and transportation. These gaps suggest significant opportunities for future research. We provide guidelines for practitioners on applying Sim-ML models to manage supply chain drivers, mitigate the impact of disruptions, and integrate emerging technologies. Our review serves as a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and students interested in leveraging Sim-ML approaches in SCM. © 2024 The Author(s)","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207951036"

This crisis started a discussion about SC sustainability and performance. Therefore, the implementation of advanced technologies and supply chain collaboration could mitigate this disruption with the help of government support and policies. Considering this situation, this paper examines how COVID-19 influences advanced technologies (Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, Blockchain, Digital twins, and Big Data Analytics) and supply chain collaboration (SCC) with a moderating role of government support and policies (GSP) in Pakistan. The study encompasses a comprehensive assessment carried out via structural equation modeling and data collected from Pakistani companies engaged in SCM or those operating within the SC divisions of manufacturing enterprises. According to the empirical findings, it is evident that COVID-19 outbreaks have a significant influence on SSCP; However, they do not show a similar impact on advanced technologies (AI, IoT, Blockchain, DT, and BDA) and supply chain collaboration, the influence of COVID-19 on SSCP was effectively mediated through advance technologies (AI, IoT, Blockchain, DT, and BDA) and supply chain collaboration. This research contributes to the existing literature on SSCP by emphasizing the importance of the resource-based view, dynamic capability view, and institutional theories. SC and logistics managers can apply the theoretical framework proposed in this study to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic or disruptions in logistics and SC operations, thereby improving profitability in the context of an epidemic. © The Author(s) 2024.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188846696"

Agriculture and particularly agri-food is imperative to contribute to solving such global challenges as climate change and food security through cleaner and greener supply chains, where the implementation of smart technologies is one of the major ways to create an impact. The pairing between the potential of digital technologies and sustainability inputs, called twin transition, is currently one of the EU policy's priorities. This research focuses on linking digitalisation and sustainability in the agri-food sector through applications of various digital technologies and the associated contributions to sustainability through the three – environmental, economic, and social - dimensions. To analyse the current debate on sustainability and digitalisation, we have utilised a systematic literature review and qualitative analysis of (policy) documents. The discussion presents a conceptual framework, which follows the process of the integration of a digital technology from its reasoning to the associated sustainability outcomes. The research identifies uneven representation of digital technologies and the structural imbalance of applications towards farming as the agri-food supply chain node and farmers as the major actors' group. The scale of these applications frame the associated contributions to the sustainability dimensions. The analysis of the sustainability outcomes brought by digitalisation through classification of their aspects can advise not only a choice of technology but also managerial and policy directions leading to the transformation. One of the ways to manage twin transition and support competitiveness on both firm and sector levels is development of a strategy, which can be supported by policy making. © 2024 The Authors","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190550983"

Specifically, this company manufactures a product using a raw material provided by an external supplier, whose lead times may abruptly change due to disruptive events. The Smoothing Order-Up-To rule is adopted by the company as a replenishment policy. It is characterized by three control parameters, which must be optimized to enhance the resilience of the system. To this end, the digital twin learns from the real production–distribution data and periodically self-adjusts the replenishment parameters based on the evolution of the external environment. The digital twin architecture combines data analytics, simulation modeling, machine learning, and a metaheuristic. More specifically, an Artificial Neural Network learns from the manufacturer's operations and generates predictive models. These are embedded in a Particle Swarm Optimization, which provides the optimal combination of the replenishment parameters. An experimental campaign was performed to demonstrate that the digital twin outperforms the traditional strategy in which the replenishment parameters are kept unchanged. The numerical results show that the digital twin strongly improves the manufacturer's performance, in particular in terms of time-to-recover and time-to-survive, used to measure the resilience of the system subject to disruption. © 2024 The Author(s)","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190329693"

By coupling simulation and machine learning, predictive models can be developed with limited historical data, and pre-crisis performance assessment can be performed to facilitate timely and informed decisions. The proposed approach enables managers to gain valuable insights into the complex evolution of the uncertain future, which also opens up the possibility of further integration with optimisation and digital twins. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191870294"

These digital copies allow for the monitoring, analysis, and optimization of their real-world counterparts. This helps to enhance decision-making and performance in areas like as manufacturing, healthcare, and urban planning. Digital twins have the capability to accurately replicate the actions and condition of their physical counterparts, allowing for the anticipation of maintenance needs, monitoring of performance, and analysis of potential scenarios. They utilize technology such as the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors, data analytics, and machine learning to consistently enhance their virtual models by incorporating real-time data from linked devices. Digital twins are utilized in several domains, such as predictive maintenance of machinery, optimization of manufacturing processes, simulation of medical operations, and even modeling of entire cities for urban planning. Digital twins improve efficiency, productivity, and creativity by offering insights into intricate systems. They also help reduce expenses and dangers involved with physical experimentation or testing. This paper covers a brief implementation of the technologies Digital Twins (DT) along with the Internet of Things (IoT) in solving the food wastage problem that happens during the post-harvest supply chain. About 30% of food gets wasted globally every year from the time it is harvested till it reaches the customer due to poor supply chain management. There is an urgent need to resolve this issue with the help of cutting-edge technologies. This depicts why it is important to reimagine the existing supply chain with detailed implementation and integration of DT. Also, there are relevant case studies and examples to strengthen the idea behind. © 2024 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207377610"

However, achieving such a spare parts supply chain management is challenging due to the intrinsic characteristics of spare parts. Traditional spare parts supply chains (TSPSCs) adopt large spare parts inventories to tackle such intrinsic characteristics, with disadvantages in terms of high inventory costs. Recently, Additive Manufacturing (AM) has shown breakthrough potential, allowing the transition from TSPSCs to digital spare parts supply chains (DSPSCs), where spare parts are no longer stored in large amounts but are stored digitally and produced only when needed. However, despite DSPSCs benefits, a complete transition from TSPSCs to DSPSCs is still far from becoming reality. Indeed, hindering such a transition is a lack of expertise in three main areas, i.e. how to design, operate, and control and monitor a DSPSC. With this position paper, we envision how a digital twin (DT) could overcome these issues, enabling a full transition to a DSPSC. Moreover, this work further concretely suggests how such a DT could be developed, providing the basis for developing both the theoretical and practical knowledge necessary to render DSPSCs a reality. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190973245"

The preparedness of Moroccan responders in handling emergencies could be enhanced significantly, by devising digital twin-based decision support systems (DSSs). Design/methodology/approach: The authors create a discrete-event simulation model to investigate proactively risks and resilience of a Moroccan basic-items SC (BISC). In this study, the authors analyze the effects of catastrophe-related disruptions (CRDs) on the Moroccan BISC, by the use of a simulation-based decision-supporting quantitative method. Findings: In the disruption-free simulation experiment, the outcome was a satisfactory 100% coverage. By implementing CRDs, inventory levels have dropped, service levels decreased, lead time raised and there was an increase in backlogged products and late orders numbers. The highest impact was observed for the shutdown of paths linking suppliers to warehouses, whereas the increase in demand had a comparatively minor effect. The risk analysis approach helps to identify critical products for which the time-to-recover is longer and requires more commitment to enhance their resilience. Practical implications: The model serves to deduce quantitative resilience assessment from simulation, streamline the selection of recovery strategies and enable the best-informed reactive decision-making to minimize the impact.

The digital twin is a virtual replica of the infrastructure with information on vulnerabilities instead the twins of the threat actors describe the attacks they can implement and their goals. We use these twins to run multiple emulations of the threat actor behaviors against the infrastructure. This supports the discovery of all the attack paths of an actor by covering stochastic factors such as the success or failure of each attack. The knowledge of the attack paths of an actor is fundamental to selecting the countermeasures to deploy to interrupt these paths and minimize cyber risk. A twin-based solution can run the emulations even before building the infrastructure and support a what-if analysis that changes some properties of the infrastructure or threat actors to evaluate how this affects the overall risk. A supply chain attack is an attack against the supplier that inserts a vulnerability or a backdoor into a module that the threat actor uses when the final user deploys the module it has received. We propose to defend from this attack by exploiting a what-if analysis that assumes that a vulnerability or a backdoor has been introduced in outsourced modules as a result of a supply chain attack against the supplier. The proposed solution requires that the infrastructure twin is extended with information on the modules used to build each infrastructure software module. We also discuss a solution that deploys of a larger number of countermeasures for each attack path. © 2022 ISRERM Organizers.

There is no denying that the agricultural sector is undergoing a digital transformation as mobile technologies, remote sensing services, and distributed computing are already improving smallholders’ access to information, inputs, and markets, increasing manufacturing and productivity, smooth supply chains, and embracing technology costs. The Indian economy heavily depends on agriculture. Over 60% of Indians work in agriculture, which also accounts for one-third of the nation’s income and contributes significantly to the development of the nation. Digitalization has had an impact on agricultural and food production systems, allowing for the use of technologies and advanced data processing techniques in the agricultural field. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the various effects of digital technologies on society through a framework that aims to provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between the physical, cyber and social strategies for successfully implementing the digital transformation of a system. Using an agriculture cyber-physical systems makes agriculture smarter, which connect Internet of Things with other technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning can aid in boosting crop yields, decreasing water waste, and lowering fertilizer usage, a range of agricultural factors that have a direct impact on crop selection. Second, it transmits this data to a server that uses it to forecast farm-ready yields. Digital farming aims to solve several existing challenges in food security, climate protection, and resource management by utilizing available information from agricultural assets. The use of digital techniques is anticipated to increase optimization and decision-making support. It covers a broad framework of digital twins in agricultural fields, including soil, irrigation, robotics, farm equipment, and food postharvest processing. Data collection, modeling, including big data, AI, simulation, analysis, and prediction as well as communication components of the digital twin in agriculture are explored. As the next phase of the digitalization paradigm, digital twin technologies can assist farmers by continuously and in real-time monitoring the physical world (the farm) and updating the state of the virtual world. The potential of digital technologies to transform the agricultural and rural sectors is often seen as a promising opportunity in various aspects of society. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

However, their relationship with lean supply chains remains understudied. We address this gap through a systematic literature review, analyzing 33 selected papers from 759 articles. Utilizing the supply-chain operations reference (SCOR) framework, we assess digital twins’ impact on supply chain processes and performances. Our findings indicate that digital twins are primarily used in plan, make, and delivery processes, with limited exploration in source and return processes. They enhance lean practices by improving information flow, eliminating waste, optimizing logistics, and enabling just-in-time production. However, top management commitment, supplier relationship management, and customer relationship management are understudied areas. We also recognize two additional areas where digital twins contribute: enhancing supply chain coordination, and bolstering supply chain resilience, particularly against disruptions such as COVID-19 and geopolitical events. Additionally, we propose a framework for digital twin-driven smart lean supply chain management and highlight the importance of future research in areas such as supply chain digital twins (SCDT) mapping, convergence, interaction, cognition and service.

We explore this question with respect to a small or medium enterprise (SME), which is cash-constrained. For the analysis, we design a digital twin to continually observe and enhance the performance of the supply chain network. We explicitly model the inventory flow and cash flow details using the system dynamics method. The inventory ordering policies are designed for the SME such that: (i) the enterprise has a nonnegative balance at all times, and (ii) a stock-out situation is avoided. Interestingly, we incorporate the business plan, designed using the tacit knowledge of the SME, while deciding the order releases. We validate the model via exhaustive simulation for scenarios with delays in delivery and random shocks to the anticipated demand. In all scenarios, the designed policies are robust against such disruptions to a large extent. Further, we highlight the significance of including a business plan in our digital twin to design a resilient supply chain.  © 2024 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203107231"

These warehouses must work seamlessly with their smart manufacturing processes. The use of modern technology has significantly increased the reliability of warehouse processes by eliminating inherent risks. This involves managing risks comprehensively through the processes of receiving, storage, picking and shipping customer’s orders. The use of I4.0 technologies in managing risks can provide improved real-time control over warehousing processes, fewer manual handling operations, reduced operating costs and a lower risk of work-related accidents. Their use, moreover, facilitate error-free expedited or cancelled customer orders, and minimize qualitative errors. The adoption of modern warehouse technology can lead to the more efficient use of space and reduced energy and labor costs. While there’s a significant amount of literature exploring Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) and the integration of I4.0 technologies into risk management practices, relatively fewer studies specifically target warehouse risks or those associated with warehouse operations. There is a notable gap in literature when it comes to this specific area within the broader context of SCRM. This research aims to explore I4.0 technologies used to manage risks throughout the warehouse’s specific internal activities or operations of receiving, storing, picking, and shipping goods. Two databases, Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) were used for comprehensive research. Different keywords were combined to identify the currently adopted technologies for managing risks in a smart warehouse. The impact of these technologies on warehouse risk management was also determined. According to our findings, we identified four major categories of risks in the forementioned warehouse processes: product recognition risks mainly at the receiving and the picking processes, controlled mostly through IoT, RFID, QR; handling goods and inventory level risks, which are focused on the storage process and are mitigated by the use of automated robotic systems or vehicles and smart shelves that can broadcast information for low inventory; human health safety and ergonomic issues which have a high risk of injuries due to repetitive lifts, picks and bends during the storage and picking processes, the utilization of robotic systems can be of great importance; finally risks regarding the quality and traceability of goods in the warehouse can be dealt with the use of smart sensors through IoT technology. We concluded that the predominant technologies used are: IoT through the use of RFID, QR and products identification enablers and robotic automations systems via robotic system and unmanned vehicles. Other I4.0 technologies in warehouse risk management, are beginning to arise such as the use of AI, AR/VR, Blockchain, Big Data, Digital Twins but are still limited. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201383049"

By offering current operational statistics visualizations of physical assets, assisting in decision-making, and mitigating possible hazards in electronic manufacturing environments, DTs are essential to the improvement of distributed consumer electronics. DTs must also work with blockchain technology in dispersed consumer electronics systems to anticipate data privacy and access control. Unfortunately, the single failure of DT collaboration is caused by centralized attacks and data interoperability, authentication, scalability, and connectivity issues. This paper provides the secure architecture for the DTs' collaboration in consumer electronic devices. Next, we have created an access control mechanism based on a consensus model that combines blockchain, digital twin, and real-time monitoring of consumer devices. The proposed framework uses blockchain technology to empower digital twin-based consumer electronic devices. Specifically, we created a collaborative blockchain architecture based on manufacturer, retailer, and device users, emphasizing a distributed chain code model and real-time access control. The experimental results show that the proposed system integration performs better than the baseline digital twin architecture. © 1975-2011 IEEE.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192211853"

While simulation has been used in logistics for a long time, digital twins extend the common notion of simulation through its capacity to support near real-time planning and decision-making. Digital twins enable a dynamic, detailed, and functional real-time representation of physical assets to monitor their performance, anticipate their future state, or control how their resources are used. Its approaches and methods to designing, developing, implementing, and updating digital models that allow modularity, reuse and evolution of their components have not yet been exhaustively developed. It is not the first time the modeling & simulation community has attempted to create real-time simulation models and tools. However, it is the first time the technologies required to develop such advanced performance assessment and planning and control systems are available to enable the functions needed to support real-time adaptive planning and decision-making. Several conceptual frameworks have been proposed to build a coherent and common understanding of planning and control systems, but its interpretation and adaptation to specific systems still require the development of dedicated methodological and technological architectures. By exploring the body of knowledge before the popularization of the term digital twins, this paper proposes a critical analysis of the technological requirements and methodological steps to implement digital twins in logistics. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to propose a methodological framework dedicated to the design, development, and operation of digital supply chain twins. © IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2024.All rights reserved.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206560134"

Digital technologies have given rise to new application and value creation scenarios, driven innovation across operations, processes, and organizational management, and empowered industrial upgrading. Thus, problems related to the lack of pre-cooling at the origin and poor information in the cold supply chain for pre-prepared foods in China were analyzed, including insufficient cold chain support facilities, irregular cold chain operations, last-mile distribution, and sales losses. The digital twin model can simulate and predict changes in the quality of pre-prepared foods during the cold chain process, while the introduction of technologies such as the Internet of Things and blockchain can enable transport monitoring and the traceability of products. This study proposes leveraging digital twin technology to establish a digital cold chain tracking and tracing system for pre-prepared foods. It aims to develop supply, digital, trust, and benefit chains within the cold pre-prepared food supply chain, exploring a digital pathway tailored to the development of pre-prepared foods in China.

They establish and foster the communication bridge between the physical and digital realms. Conversely, the metaverse represents an extension of digital twins, recognized as the 3D evolution of the Internet. These technologies aim to narrow the divide between the digital domain and human interaction, garnering considerable attention from academia and industry. Despite the metaverse predating digital twins by a decade, it remains in its emerging stages. In contrast, digital twins have found extensive applications across diverse fields. However, they are plagued by numerous security and privacy vulnerabilities that demand resolution for future communications. Therefore, leveraging the immutability and transparency inherent in blockchain, we have implemented these features into digital twins within the metaverse to enhance security and privacy. Consequently, a blockchain-empowered framework for the metaverse utilizing digital twins has been outlined. Furthermore, we have showcased the diverse applications of digital twins in the metaverse across various sectors. We have also designed a supply chain digital twins use-case scenario within the metaverse. The conceptual design and implementation details for the supply chain use case are discussed, focusing on traceability and data immutability. The proposed supply chain scenario is validated concerning various computational metrics.

Through continuous monitoring and prediction of the condition of fresh fruit, a digital twin—the virtual twin of a crop—can assist in the reduction of wasted pomegranates. The introduction of the thermal camera as a data-gathering instrument was due to its capacity to identify surface and physical changes in stored fruits. Using SAP’s smart technologies, we trained a model with four distinct sets of temperature data for this experiment. We tracked the fruits’ condition by training a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with temperature data. The technology’s achievement of 0.99 prediction accuracy shows that it has great potential for creating digital twins of fruits.

The original equipment manufacturers outsource many of the parts which are not their core competencies to leverage the globalized production for reduced cost. However, the complexity associated with the supply chain and the manufacturing process have increased and have become critical. The modular learning factories designed to understand, develop, and train industry 4.0 based manufacturing solutions should be able to oversee these complexities of globalized or de-centralized production with different quality standards. Digital twins of manufacturing applications mimic the real time working and has the potential to be developed as a platform – Digital twin as a Service – for collaborative learning factories. This paper proposes a federated digital twin based collaborative learning factory framework to develop manufacturing solutions for global scenarios. The network of learning factories provides a globalized field to train and test solutions. The proposed framework is elaborated with a use case on the development of federated digital twins for production, assembly, and inspection systems. The proposed solution is expected to help in improving the productivity and better planning for disruptions in production.

Applying the theoretical lens of the practice-based view (PBV), the present research analyses five cases to illustrate how DTTs beneficially support SC viability (SCV) practices, enhancing operational performance subsequently. The study uses secondary data to provide empirical evidence on the Digital supply chain practice model (DSCPM). The findings highlight the DTT’s role in facilitating SCV practices, enhancing visibility, adaptability and velocity. From a managerial perspective, however, the study reveals a notable gap between potential benefits and practical implementations of DTTs. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206560180"

Simulation plays a vital role in this balance, identifying risks, analyzing scenarios, and evaluating key performance indicators. However, existing simulation models often overlook suppliers and inventory management, focusing more on production, sales, and distribution. To address this, a simulation model tailored for the furniture industry integrates supplier selection with inventory management strategies, considering geographical complexities. Through a case study, various scenarios are assessed, revealing a trade-off between lead times and costs. Close MTO suppliers decrease lead times but increase costs due to transportation expenses, while distant sourcing minimizes costs but extends lead times, challenging customer expectations. This simulation model offers insights for MTO companies navigating supplier selection and inventory management, enhancing decision-making and customer satisfaction. Future research aims to expand the model into a supply chain Digital Twin, incorporating resilience and risk management to tackle broader MTO supply chain challenges. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2024.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204519393"

Digital twins reflect real objects and processes in a virtual environment, which enables analysis, modelling and optimisation of supply chain operations. The author describes the main stages of the project, including requirements definition, system architecture development, implementation and testing. Particular attention is paid to the benefits of using digital twins in supply chain management, such as increased efficiency, reduced risk and improved forecasting. The results of the study show the potential of digital twins to optimise supply chain management and increase the competitiveness of companies. The article presents an approach to building a new model of interaction and systematic optimisation of business processes based on digital technologies at all stages of supply chain formation, which ensures the creation of a digital twin for the maritime transport chain. In order to improve supply chains, a digital twin has been proposed, which opens up great prospects for the management of logistics processes and the exchange of information between supply chain participants. This paper presents a framework for an integral Digital Supply Chain Twin (DSCT) capable of covering the entire transport chain. The proposed information system based on the use of the DSCT provides a number of improvements throughout the supply chain, as well as the ability to model and evaluate different scenarios for the supply chain. This creates opportunities to reduce the cost of organising and coordinating transport, improve the quality of transport and logistics services and make them more reliable by identifying potential problems at an early stage.

However, most studies in the field of supply chain digital twin have only focused on what-if analysis that compares several different scenarios. This study proposes a data-driven evolutionary algorithm to efficiently solve the service constrained inventory optimization problem using historical data that generated by supply chain digital twins. The objective is to minimize the total costs while satisfying the required service level for a supply chain. The random forest algorithm is used to build surrogate models which can be used to estimate the total costs and service level in a supply chain. The surrogate models are optimized by an ensemble approach-based differential evolution algorithm which can adaptively use different search strategies to improve the performance during the computation process. A three-echelon supply chain digital twin on the geographic information system (GIS) map in real-time is used to examine the efficiency of the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that the data-driven evolutionary algorithm can reduce the total costs and maintain the required service level. The finding suggests that our proposed method can learn from the historical data and generate better inventory policies for a supply chain digital twin. © The Author(s) 2023.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167363918"

Cluster tools are essential equipment in semiconductor production and are used for microscopic operations, such as the surface treatment of wafers. In particular, the operational parameters of cluster tools directly affect productivity, and various efforts are underway to optimize them at manufacturing sites. However, there are still many challenges in this process. In this study, we propose a framework for optimizing the operational parameters of cluster tools in semiconductor manufacturing using digital twin technology to address these challenges. The framework predicts productivity through manufacturing simulations based on operational parameters in a digital twin environment, analyzes the factors affecting productivity, and determines the optimal operational parameters. The study demonstrates that the cycle time of cluster tools in wafer fabrication can be significantly reduced through the proposed approach based on digital twins. The application of this framework is expected to contribute to cost reduction, productivity improvement, and enhancement of industrial competitiveness at semiconductor manufacturing sites.  © 2024 The Authors.

Information systems (IS) are implemented to overcome these gaps as part of digitalization efforts. In the CE context, IS can provide insights into the sustainability and circularity of a product and its value chain. In fact, many products come into existence through supply chains encompassing plentiful suppliers and complex in-use and after-use streams. Implementing CE IS, like obligatory product passports, will significantly scale up information technologies (IT) use. Environmental impacts through IT use, and diverse product lifecycles call for an architecture that allows such a degree of complexity while minimizing burdens. This conference paper summarizes our preliminary results on designing an architecture for CE IS. First, we reviewed the literature on product passports. We created an architecture based on the design science methodology, including a meta-model providing an overview of all concepts. We also show how the architecture can facilitate the CE IS implementation by an example case of remanufacturing. Our results advocate rethinking the concept of product-centered systems towards IS that are more based on CE and digital services. © 2024 Elsevier B.V..

Major problems are mainly because there is no realtime data collection and increasing latency. Real-time monitoring of the factors like demand, credit transactions, and logistics, will enhance the responsiveness of the supply chain (SC) network. There are multiple approaches that can address existing problems and most of them revolve around dynamic response and real-time solutions. Analysing all the existing technologies and methods, it is found that digital twin (DT) can be more productive. Integrating DDT with SC and the logistics network will overrule most of the crises faced in the industries. Creating a DT of SC network will incorporate all the parameters involved in a network with the cloud system. This enables monitoring of all the elements of the supply chain and logistics in real-time many medium-scale and even developed industries are actually facing hardship in their routing and transportation system. Transportation of goods and the routing network is a crucial part of the industry which directly has an impact on the revenue. DT helps distribution centers to develop metrics for predicting the demand, vehicle utilisation, maintenance of temperature, optimisation of routes, transactions and diagnostics of possible outcomes. So, this project is mainly focusing on optimizing the transportation and routing network. It also includes real-time tracking of the transport vehicles. The main reason is that in most well-organised industries there is a major problem in tracking the supply of raw materials. Initially, the network-level analysis is done manually and using various data analytics software. The data collected will be used to provide solutions to real-time problems. This project focuses on building a DT of the logistics network using Microsoft Azure and IoT sensors. Through implementation, it is estimated that even small to medium-scale distribution centers can attain transparency in the SC network. In this study, the impact of real-time data of the transportation network on the overall SC Network is quantified through various analyses. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Bjorn Schuller, Rajiv Gupta, Rakesh Mote, Abhishek Sharma, J.P.

By generalizing the notion of digital twins, we review, develop, and conceptualize the (emerging) notion of digital twins of supply chains (DTofSC). While digital twins is an active research area with data available from numerous industry projects, its application to supply chains is just emerging as a cross discipline stemming from decades of maturing the notion of digital supply chains. While digital twins has been used in supply chains, the notion of digitalization of supply chains is only a nascent area, with imprecise definitions beyond key metaphors (e.g., visibility, traceability); as we conceptualize, the overall vision is to create technical and organizational mechanisms enabling any supply chain to be monitored and controlled from, e.g., a dashboard screen. After a literature review on the intersections between digital supply chains, digital twins, and digital technologies (e.g., blockchain), we propose a synthesis systems architecture of DTofSC, identify a key requirement gap (that we term addressability), and ground our contributions, and in the absence of real-world use-cases in practice, we apply our conceptualized systems architecture to battery recycling based on feedback from an industry-targeted workshop. © 2024 IEEE.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205011448"

The virtualization of the food supply chain offers opportunities to evaluate, simulate, and predict challenges and mishaps potentially contributing to present and future food safety risks. Food systems virtualization poses several requirements: (1) a comprehensive framework composed of instrumental, digital, and computational methods to evaluate internal and external factors that impact food safety; (2) nondestructive and real-time sensing methods, such as spectroscopic-based techniques, to facilitate mapping and tracking food safety and quality indicators; (3) a dynamic platform supported by the Internet of Things (IoT) interconnectivity to integrate information, perform online data analysis and exchange information on product history, outbreaks, exposure to risky situations, etc.; and (4) comprehensive and complementary mathematical modeling techniques (including but not limited to chemical reactions and microbial inactivation and growth kinetics) based on extensive data sets to make realistic simulations and predictions possible. Despite current limitations in data integration and technical skills for virtualization to reach its full potential, its increasing adoption as an interactive and dynamic tool for food systems evaluation can improve resource utilization and rational design of products, processes and logistics for enhanced food safety.

A Green Gateway is a type of decision that supports to realizing the full potential of products and materials. Indeed, the potential value of products and materials must be assessed and leveraged and the concept of Green Gateway will be useful to identify common decisions and to define a common framework in the future. The integration of digital information and digital twins of products, processes, and circular value and supply chains emerges as a key factor in guiding decision-makers effectively, especially for Green Gateways where adequate information, tools and methods must be used to manage value retention options, product flows, production and pricing decisions jointly with the multiple objectives of profitability and sustainability.

This model is specifically designed to address the difficulties of modern logistics networks and encourage operational efficiency in real-timmethodologye settings. To analyze and understand the huge datasets commonly found in industry 4.0 logistics systems, ADAPT-CP uses deep lean learning. This advanced learning is great in revealing hidden patterns and insights from non-Euclidean data structures, which are common in interconnected logistics networks. ADAPT-CP increases decision-making processes, predictive accuracy and resource allocation by directly implementing geometric deep learning techniques, including convolution and pooling, on cyber-physical graphs. Fuzzy logic rules have been built into ADAPT-CP, so that the model can efficiently handle the essential uncertainties and variabilities of logistical operations. By analyzing unclear data and applying a set of flexible rules that can adjust to changing situations, this combination makes it easier to make exact decisions. As a result, more control and efficiency are made possible by ADAPT-CP and it has an ability to provide strong, immediate solutions to logistical problems. Additionally, to improve the accuracy and reliability of logistics processes, ADAPT-CP's combined application of deep lean learning and fuzzy logic rules promotes sustainable growth by raising customer happiness and service quality. Moreover, execution of these combined techniques promotes cooperative relations across various supply chain stakeholders such as manufacturers, distributors and suppliers. ADAPT-CP effectively transforms logistics into a scalable, intelligent and adaptable management solution that will perform well in diverse modern business scenarios.

The problem is set referring to a real case study of the logistics hub of a tire distributor company. The DT was built and validated based on real data from plant sensors and information systems. Afterwards, the DT was used to define three picking strategies that differently impact on both picking and outbound loading efficiency. The DT was then employed on a daily basis and fed with real orders, machine and rack availability to replicate stocking and picking operations and to directly communicate the recommended picking strategy to the warehouse PLC. Several demand scenarios have been considered to extend managerial inferences. Results show that the DT is a valuable tool to support the balancing of picking and outbound loading performance. © The Author(s) 2024.","","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195980418"

Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) optimize the movement of goods, while Internet of Things (IoT) enhances connectivity and data collection for improved decision-making. Robots automate tasks like picking and packing, increasing efficiency and reducing errors. Blockchain technology enhances transparency and traceability in the supply chain, building trust and reducing fraud. Digital twins create virtual replicas of warehouses for simulation and optimization, enabling proactive problem-solving and improved resource allocation. Such transformation addresses the increasing complexity and dynamic nature of warehousing in the modern marketplace. This systematic literature review, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, investigates the role of optimization models in this digital shift from 2010 to 2023. The findings highlight the crucial enhancements and practical implications brought about by these technologies, showcasing their impact on streamlining operations. These improvements include advancements in path planning, task allocation, inventory management and storage assignment which significantly enhance operational effectiveness within warehousing. The results demonstrate a 25-30% increase in perishable food freshness, a 10% reduction in picking time, a 14.8% increase in space utilization, and a 9.95% decrease in total costs. Moreover, the findings call attention to the insufficient analysis on the economic implications of digital transformations in warehousing, notably in cost reductions and Return on Investment (ROI) evaluations which are crucial metrics for evaluating the financial success and wider benefits of digital transformation initiatives, such as customer satisfaction and revenue growth. The review also identifies critical research gaps, including the need to incorporate sustainability into optimization models, strategies for adapting to dynamic environments, the exploration of collaborative robots (cobots), and the optimization of reverse logistics and returns. This review provides a comprehensive foundation for future research and emphasizes the potential of digitalization to revolutionize warehousing practices through innovative optimization strategies and real-world applications.  © 2013 IEEE.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204732421"

Temperature control is the cornerstone of postharvest conservation, and apples are typically kept at temperatures ranging from 0 to 3 °C. However, the energy-intensive process of the initial cool-down and subsequent temperature maintenance poses significant financial challenges with adverse effects on the carbon footprint. Higher storage temperatures could reduce cooling-related energy usage but also pose the risk of enhanced ripening and quality loss. This work explores different storage technologies aiming to reduce energy consumption, such as 1-methylcyclopropene, ultra-low oxygen, and a dynamically controlled atmosphere with raised temperatures. The integration of advanced monitoring and control systems, coupled with data analytics and energy management, in apple storage is also discussed. These strategies can be implemented without cost-intensive construction measures in standard storage facilities. Furthermore, beneficial side effects of higher storage temperatures in terms of a reduced occurrence of storage disorder symptoms and higher maintenance of quality attributes are also discussed for this special issue on sustainable horticultural production systems and supply chains. © 2024 by the authors.","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184695319"

The challenge is to investigate the challenges that make integration for a seamless digital twin in supply chain operations smooth, using the Best–Worst Method (BWM) and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to systematically prioritize the challenges faced. That ensures a comprehensive view across a broad industry spectrum and operational contexts by drawing on the insights elicited from an appropriate sample of supply chain professionals.

To address this issue, this research work presents a multi-purpose platform that can be used by SMEs as easy-to use support tool to run what-if analyses to optimize their products and production processes design. The platform fulfills the requirements of interoperability, accessibility, and usability and is built upon a layered infrastructure, consisting of specific modules within its Decision-Making Layer, Data Exchange Layer, and User Management Layer. The platform integrates several software, including Plant Simulation, Autodesk Inventor Nastran, and Autodesk Inventor Nesting, to simulate production processes, to run finite element analysis, and to optimize raw material utilization. The interoperability and data exchange are ensured through the adoption of FIWARE, an open-source framework for IoT platforms, which enables the harmonized representation of data formats and semantics among different applications and software within the platform. The User Management Layer allows SMEs to easily interact with the platform, making it an easy-to-use tool even for those with limited IT competencies. A case study conducted by an SME in the furniture sector demonstrated the platform's effectiveness in achieving optimal design and production of a new bookcase, resulting in increased efficiency, reduced costs, and improved profitability. The modular structure of the platform enables potential future integration of additional modules, such as quality control, supply chain management, etc., further enhancing its capabilities and potential benefits for SMEs.

Ventilated packaging plays a key role in maintaining fruit quality along the supply chain. However, every supply chain is composed of different unit operations, and every shipment encounters unique hygrothermal conditions such as air temperature fluctuations over time, sub-optimal humidity conditions, and the risk of condensation. Therefore, every supply chain has an optimal packaging that provides the best hygrothermal climate and ventilation to the fruit. Given the vast space of potential supply chain scenarios and packaging configurations, in-silico studies are an attractive alternative for selecting this optimal packaging. In this study, we developed physics-based digital twins for ventilated packaging of strawberries. We utilized measured air temperature and humidity data from an actual supply chain from the farm to the retail store. With these digital twins, we mimicked in-silico how the strawberries evolve hygrothermally, physiologically, and microbiologically along the supply chain inside 21 different types of ventilated packaging. We predicted actionable metrics of fruit quality and shelf life for these 21 packages. These metrics include total mass loss, risk of putative mold infection due to Botrytis cinerea, retention time of condensate, and remaining shelf life based on respiration, transpiration, and mold growth. In addition, we analyzed the impact of package-related metrics, such as total vent area, degree of filling, pressure drop across the package, and seven-eighths cooling time, on fruit quality metrics. With this approach, we pinpointed the critical quality loss points in the supply chain for every package. We identified the package that performs best in balancing the three-way trade-off between the respiration-driven biochemical shelf life, transpiration-driven physical shelf life, and mold growth-driven microbial shelf life of fruit. Our findings showed that the performance of open trays is comparable to ventilated clamshells, as long as a high humidity is maintained along the supply chain. Flow-wrapped packages presented the highest risk of condensation and microbial growth. We also quantified the spatial heterogeneity in fruit quality within the packages and highlighted the most vulnerable locations for quality loss inside each packaging type. Our study presents a novel, holistic approach to select the optimal ventilated packaging of strawberries from farm to retailer based on its measured hygrothermal fingerprint. This approach can help reduce food loss and contribute towards making supply chains smart and efficient. © 2023 The Authors","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148341612"

Energy efficiency assessment and carbon emission accounting can provide theoretical tools and practical support for the formulation of energy conservation and emission reduction strategies for the food cold chain, and is also a prerequisite for the sustainable development of the food cold chain. In this paper, the relationship and differences between energy consumption and carbon emissions in the general food cold chain are first described, and the principle, advantages and disadvantages of three energy consumption conversion standards of solar emergy value, standard coal and equivalent electricity are discussed. Besides, the possibilities of applying these three energy consumption conversion standards to energy consumption analysis and energy efficiency evaluation of food cold chain are explored. Then, for a batch of fresh agricultural products, the energy consumption of six links of the food cold chain, including the first transportation, the manufacturer, the second transportation, the distribution center, the third transportation, and the retailer, are systematically and comprehensively analyzed from the product level, and the comprehensive energy consumption level of the food cold chain are obtained. On this basis, ten energy efficiency indicators from five aspects of macro energy efficiency are proposed, including micro energy efficiency, energy economy, environmental energy efficiency and comprehensive energy efficiency, and constructs the energy efficiency evaluation index system of food cold chain. At the same time, other energy efficiency evaluation indicators and methods are also summarized. In addition, the standard of carbon emission conversion of food cold chain, namely carbon dioxide equivalent is introduce, the boundary of carbon emission accounting is determined, and the carbon emission factors of China's electricity is mainly discussed. Furthermore, the origin, principle, advantages and disadvantages of the emission factor method, the life cycle assessment method, the input-output analysis method and the hybrid life cycle assessment method, and the basic process of life cycle assessment method in the calculation of food cold chain carbon footprint are also reviewed. In order to improve the energy efficiency level of the food cold chain and reduce the carbon emissions of each link of the food cold chain, energy conservation and emission reduction methods for food cold chain are proposed from five aspects: refrigerant, distribution path, energy, phase change cool storage technology and digital twin technology. Finally, the energy efficiency assessment and carbon emission accounting of the food cold chain are briefly prospected in order to provide reference for promoting the sustainable development of China's food cold chain. © 2023 Chinese Journal of Animal Nutrition.

This paper addresses the research gap in designing and using next-generation manufacturing execution systems (MES)/manufacturing operations management (MOM) in IIoT to improve manufacturing flexibility through reconfigurability. For this, we follow an abductive research design and build on the literature on Industry 4.0′s information architectures and models to propose a framework for building smart factory capabilities. Using the framework, we collect empirical data on MES/MOM implementation objectives for smart factories for six case studies conducted over a 4-year research project in Denmark (2018–2021), primarily through semi-structured interviews. Through cross-case analysis, we identify seven dominant themes that capture focus areas for MES/MOM implementation for IT/OT integration. We use these findings to present generalized design recommendations for IIoT-connected MES/MOM to support reconfigurability for Industry 4.0 supply chains. Our findings indicate that despite considerable investments from many companies in Industry 4.0 initiatives such as artificial intelligence-based analytics and digital twins, the industry is not yet in a state to extract the data from all its legacy production equipment. Therefore, we present design recommendations to enable Industry 4.0 supply chains with IIoT-connected MES/MOM by using the data from OT devices. Our analysis helps us conclude that open standards and open application programming interfaces (APIs) are key requirements for enhancing IIoT interconnectivity and interoperability to achieve end-to-end integration in supply chains. © 2023 The Authors","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151479482"

The high degree of integration of modern companies supports the holistic view of the supply chain management (SCM) process, and require much more precise approaches on control procedures, considering analysis as well as synthesis of functions, targets, and management parameters. The aim of the research is to outline an appropriate cybernetic management model within a conceptual framework, so that it can be used for solving contradicting objectives in operational planning, as well as fulfil tasks in budget planning and give guidelines for management tasks in the logistic functions. First it was split the complex tasks of holistic planning into smaller steps, which allows to analyse separately the logistic functions and therefore dimensions of supply chain, and manage them by setting targets, design actuating variables and manage control variables using the parameter of the Total Logistic Cost (TLC) approach. With this approach it is shown how to determine and to manage complex reciprocal dependencies between the actuating variables of the logistic function and the targeting in the operational planning as well as the control variables used as measures in the budgeting process. This approach enriches additionally the understandings of smart data in digital-twin solutions, and it is a conceptual basis for artificial learning theory, as it may serve as a framework for optimization and simulation-oriented software advanced solutions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188430964"

As a result of digitalization, today's interconnected, automated systems in the factory and office can be more smoothly integrated. Many businesses consider sustainability, supply chain resilience (SCR), and supply chain performance (SCP) as the central tenet of their company's strategy for adapting to the innovations of the digital twins (DT). It is interesting to note that it is difficult to find any research study that specifically discusses the role of digital twins in improving sustainability. Also, this research has measured digital twins' influence on sustainability and identified the mediating role of SCR and SCP upon supply chain sustainability. This research identifies how the SCP and SCR impact the relationship between digital twins and sustainability. This work utilized partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine the hypothesis relationships. Data were collected from 203 respondents working in the manufacturing supply chain (MSC) area to fulfill objectives, employing closed-ended questionnaires. The results showed that digitalization has a considerable effect on supply chain sustainability. SCR and SCP are also shown to play a pivotal mediating function between DT and sustainability. Our findings have significant consequences for managers looking to implement DT to improve their supply chains' resilience, performance, and sustainability. Based on the results of this research, using DT can greatly improve the standard of supply chain operations. Helping businesses anticipate supply chain disruptions primarily benefits the preparedness aspect of the supply chain. The supply chain processes are also made more adaptable and robust, which aids businesses in dealing with interruptions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175868609"

By learning from the food industry which shares similar complexity, prolonged supply chain, and numerous stakeholders, this research aims to develop a framework deployable for material provenance tracing and tracking in the construction industry. It does so by mixing the uses of (a) cross-sectoral learning; (b) design science research; and (c) internet of things (IoT) and blockchain technology. The developed framework has four interconnected layers, namely the business layer with different stakeholders and activities, the IoT layer to collect the provenance footprints, the blockchain layer with a mainchain to store open provenance data and sidechains to store organizational private data, and the application layer to facilitate the management of quality, safety, payment, logistic and supply chain, and sustainability. The underpinning philosophy of the framework is to capture the IoT-driven provenance footprints and put them in custody in blockchain. The framework is further illustrated and refined by using a pilot construction project in Hong Kong, which was endeavored to track steel provenance from its adjacent Pearl River Delta, the so-called “World's Factory”. The framework shows enormous prospects, e.g., adopting digital twins, lifecycle traceability, improved efficiency, and transparent operations, meanwhile facing challenges, e.g., under-developed regulations, scalability issues, and information leakage risks, which all call for future research. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149853703"

DTs, as virtual counterparts of physical entities or systems, hold substantial potential for optimising and overseeing manufacturing processes. This paper provides an in-depth understanding of manufacturing systems DTs from a supply chain (SC) perspective. A three-dimensional framework is introduced embracing DT integration levels, SC structural hierarchies, and SC processes to examine the evolution of DTs. The paper delves into existing studies concerning these dimensions, identifying a shortfall in structural and process embeddedness of DT implementation within manufacturing systems. Additionally, we delve into major performance objectives and challenges inherent in the DT implementation.

With the evolution of Industry 4.0, the integration of digital informatics and decisions is crucial for smart manufacturing, Logistics 4.0, and supply chain digitization. However, much of digital content lacks interconnection. As such, the Digital Twin (DT) was proposed to promote the integration of physical machines and devices with the digital space. Augmented reality (AR) usually works in conjunction with the DT network to collect and provide real-time data. In fact, most of the AR devices are not fully connected in DT as the decision support from AI is disconnected. On the other hand, human-machines and object interactions are still complicated in AR, thus limiting applications. In order to achieve digital twinning for object recognition and human-machine interaction, we proposed a DT architecture for integrating the latest Mixed Reality (MR) device for real-time data streaming. Object recognition is empowered by the AI algorithm in the backend cloud computing and database. The entire system integrates the informatics between physical machines and devices and the digital content using an AI algorithm. Our proposed method achieved real-time informatics integration of MR and AI, while the warehouse is used as a case scenario with simulations.

In the stability-based view, resilience is triggered by disruptions and performance deviations to return to some ‘normal’ states. This view accounts for known-known uncertainty. The adaptation-based view shifts the focus from avoiding oscillations and recovering some stable states toward proactive adaptation and performance persistence. The adaptation-based view aims at designing structurally adaptable networks with process flexibility and actively used redundancy. It considers resilience from the value-creation perspective accounting for unknown-unknown uncertainties. Stability-based approach views resilience as an outcome or quantity. Adaptation-based approach considers resilience as a property or quality. A combination of stability- and adaptation-based approaches is imperative for building a strong supply chain immunity through an integration of general protection and adaptability. These approaches complement each other depending on the knowledge of and attitude to uncertainty by decision-makers. A combination of the two views helps consider resilience both as a quantity to measure how sick the supply chain is and to understand how the resilience comes about to ensure the quality of the network health and viability. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169810015"

The PIMA Nuclear Alliance will facilitate nuclear research, critical infrastructure, policy, community engagement, education, and workforce development to augment the country’s dependency on non-renewable energy resources to more resilient, sustainable, high-capacity sources of energy. Advanced nuclear technologies including microreactors (aka nuclear batteries), small modular reactors and fusion reactors are opening opportunities for non-carbon firm sources of energy that are dispatchable and versatile to meet difficult-to-decarbonize sectors of the economy. From the standpoint of sustainable economic development and a just clean energy transition, nuclear-based technologies offer safe, secure, and reliable energy while abating the impact of fossil fuels to our climate and local regional communities. The long-term vision of the PIMA Nuclear Alliance is the establishment of a technology corridor for manufacturing advanced nuclear microreactors at scale. The goal is to enable a future where 10’s to 100’s of thousands of reactors are manufactured in the region resulting in a “tera factory” (i.e. 100,000*10MWe = 1 TWe) transforming a high-tech supply chain for advanced reactors in the world. The PIMA Nuclear Alliance has a holistic approach with three primary aims: 1) to establish a research, develoment & deployment (RD&D) microreactor platform for end users and stakeholders to test energy conversion systems to their applications, 2) to engage communities and end users in participatory practices for the adoption of advanced nuclear technologies, and 3) to innovate enabling technologies (e.g. digital twin, advanced manufacturing, AIML, etc.), as well as regulatory and policy frameworks to accelerate and scale deployment of advanced reactors in the US and abroad. © 2023, Policy Studies Organization.

IIoT enables wide-scope data collection and utilisation, and reduces errors, increases efficiency, and provides an improved understanding of the process in return. While this novel solution is the pillar of Industry 4.0, the inherent operational complexity of bioprocessing arising from the involvement of living systems or their components in manufacturing renders the sector a challenging one for the implementation of IIoT. A large segment of the industry comprises the manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals and advanced therapies, some of the most valuable biotechnological products available, which undergo tight regulatory evaluations and scrutinization from product conceptualisation to patient delivery. Extensive process understanding is what biopharmaceutical industry strives for, however, the complexity of transition into a new mode of operation, potential misalignment of priorities, the need for substantial investments to facilitate transition, the limitations imposed by the downtime required for transition and the essentiality of regulatory support, render it challenging for the industry to adopt IIoT solutions to integrate with biomanufacturing operations. There is currently a need for universal solutions that would streamline the implementation of IIoT and overcome the widespread reluctance observed in the sector, which will recommend accessible implementation strategies, effective employee training and offer valuable insights in return to advance any processing and manufacturing operation within their respective regulatory frameworks. © 2023 The Authors","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175204925"

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has renewed the interest of the Sustainable Supply Chain (SSC) stakeholders on sustainability. The stakeholders are now rethinking their business processes and strategy to make them sustainable. In this context, the relevant literature is required to support emerging markets to formulate sustainability-focussed strategies. The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive analysis of potential antecedents that leads towards sustainable development of freight transportation in emerging markets. Design/methodology/approach: Initially, the antecedents of the Sustainable Freight Transport (SFT) system are derived from the literature survey followed by verification from the experts. Then, the potential antecedents are categorized under four (social, organizational, operational and environmental) broad categories. Afterwards, a Neutrosophic Analytic Network Process (N-ANP) method is employed to obtain the priority weights of the identified potential antecedents. Findings: The paper identified and ranked 17 antecedents of the SFT system. According to the study’s findings, the top three antecedents of SFT are “the presence of a multimodal transportation system,” “circularity in SFT” and “traffic congestion management”. The results from the study advocate the promotion of existing multi-modal transport facilities which is promising to achieve sustainability. The results suggested the adoption of the digital twin to manage the transport operations. Originality/value: This study sheds light on how to achieve sustainability in the freight transportation system post-COVID era highlighting the potential antecedents. The study’s findings will assist practitioners in developing SFT strategies in the face of such pandemics in future. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138138528"

The starting point of the journey is Bruno Latour’s concept: “On not joining the dots” [1] - or as we claim “on finally joining the dots” - according to which everything tangible and intangible is connected. And connecting the disciplines through data-driven logistics is what this session is all about. If the key to success is to eliminate redundancies and duplications and to overcome the boundaries within the entire value chain, which in turn means linking all available information and making it universally accessible to determine the most efficient production process - then smart logistics is that key. Data-driven logistics creates a model-based production process (BIM2LOG a “digital twin”) that leverages the “invisible” spaces off-site, which are provided in the form of data and “materialize” on-site. If smart logistics is the key to success on the construction site and is itself based on a smart city infrastructure, then this infrastructure is critical to the success of a project. In this paper we will analyze two dimensions in construction logistics: the dimension of time (joining the project stages) from early planning to execution and the dimension of space (joining the construction supply chain) from a consolidation center to the very production on site. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174450783"

There is an absence of knowledge of how a SC master plan should be updated to cope with disruptions using hybrid modelling. To fill this gap, we present a hybrid modelling framework to update a SC master plan in presence of disruptions. The proposed framework, which is a precursor to a SC digital twin, integrates simulation, machine learning, and optimisation to identify the production, storage, and distribution values that maximise SC service level while minimising total cost under disruptions. This approach proves effective in a SC disrupted by demand increase and lead time extension. Results show that employing hybrid modelling leads to a noticeable improvement in service level and total cost. The outcome of the new knowledge on using hybrid modelling for managing disruptions provides essential learning for the extension of modelling through a digital twin for SC master planning. We observe that in the presence of disruptions it is more economical to keep higher inventory at downstream SC members than the upstream SC members. © 2023 The Author(s).

This study also identified several challenges that hinder the widespread implementation of DT in construction, including (i) data integration and interoperability, (ii) data accuracy and completeness, (iii) scalability and complexity, (iv) privacy and security, and (v) standards and governance. To address these challenges, this paper recommends prioritising standardised data formats, protocols, and APIs for seamless collaboration, exploring semantic data modelling and ontologies for data integration, implementing validation processes and robust data governance for accuracy and completeness, harnessing high-performance computing and advanced modelling techniques for scalability and complexity, establishing comprehensive data protection and access controls for privacy and security, and developing widely accepted standards and governance frameworks with industry-wide collaboration. By addressing these challenges, the construction industry can unlock the full potential of DT technology, thus enhancing safety, reliability, and efficiency in construction projects. © 2023 by the authors.","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166510353"

This paper aims to provide critical insights into the potential for Digital Twins to meet the key challenges of the FSC and establish a comprehensive conceptual framework for their implementation. Following a systematic literature review (SLR), the study identified 81 peer-reviewed, high-quality papers published over the last decade (2012–2023). The typology-driven thematic analysis emphasises the emergent nature of DTs within FSCs, highlighting their key characteristics including monitoring, real-time simulation, and scenario analysis. The identified characteristics, applications, implementation drivers and barriers of Digital Twin form the basis for a novel conceptual framework for implementing DTs in FSCs. Leveraging insights from Innovation Adoption Theory and the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, the study outlines a structured five step implementation process divided into three stages. Notably, technology assessment and performance evaluation emerge as two innovative steps necessary for the successful implementation of DTs specifically, not previously considered by the theory.

Literature has addressed the need to understand digital twins in SCOM, mostly focusing on fragmented technological solutions and use cases. We start with an integrative literature review to determine which elements belong to research on digital twins in SCOM. We define the seven major elements of a digital twin in SCOM: technology, people, management, organisation, scope, task, and modelling. We also distinguish five major types of digital twins in SCOM: product, process, organisation, supply chain and network-of-networks. Illustration of a SCOM digital twin is provided using an anyLogistix example. We conclude that digital twins in SCOM are not merely a simulation-based replica of a real object but a complex socio-technical phenomenon involved in continuous human-artificial intelligence interactions. This leads to an understanding of the role of digital twins through the lens of Industry 5.0, reconfigurable and viable supply chains. Researchers and practitioners alike can use our framework to structure the knowledge on SCOM digital twins and consider all seven elements when designing and using digital twins. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161339064"

Most consumers simply return home and come back to the grocery store at a future date/time in anticipation that they will find the produce. However, there is no guarantee that on their return, the produce will have arrived in the store or be available on the shelves. These events can lead to disappointments, wasted travel time and effort, and cost. The goal of this paper is to enable farm produce consumers to track the location, distribution, and time when their produce will be arriving at the grocery store via a mobile application. However, there are challenges to address such as not disclosing the actual location of drivers/distributors to the public due to safety and privacy concerns. Thus, we adopted digital twin (i.e., virtual replicas of the actual location data) techniques to enhance data confidentiality. The mobile application is a distributed architecture with a cloud-based middleware server and a database. The preliminary testing of the work shows that consumers are happy with the mobile application, and the system evaluation also confirms the feasibility of deploying such a mobile product.  © 2023 ACM.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181817790"

This leads to a condition where customers don't have information about the origins of their products. Thus, traceability has become an essential sub-system of manufacturing supply chain management. However, due to globalization and complexity of supply chain interactions among the suppliers and manufacturing enterprises, it is hard to pinpoint the exact contributions of different actors in a supply chain. Integrated supply network structure with suitable visibility and usage of real time data transfer is another area of great importance. This paper focuses on how NFT (Non-Fungible Token) coupled with smart contracts could utilize blockchain to make it easier to track the products in a supply chain. Explaining how NFT's could help in tracking the contributions of different stakeholders in a supply chain by tracking the product throughout the entire process of sourcing, production, and sale by using a digital twin. In a manufacturing supply chain enabled by NFT Technology, whenever raw materials are transferred and processed through the supply chain, an NFT would be attached to its digital twin which will capture the created values. Each NFT can easily and uniquely be known by its data stored. Data would be updated based on real time information and will enable the stakeholders to trace the product information about how much each company has contributed to the produced products. The data stored in the form of a smart contract in the blockchain prevents the data being entered from being destroyed, eliminated, or changed without permission. Thus, there is a secure data flow among different stakeholders. © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we develop and solve an integrated problem of procurement, production, and distribution strategies (PPDs) in a medium-scale food processing company. Using the digital twin approach, the model considers the industrial symbiosis opportunities between the supplier, manufacturer, and customer using interval and sequence variables operating in a constrained environment using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and agent-based simulation (ABS) methodology. The study optimizes the make-span and lead time, simultaneously achieving a higher level of digitalization. The analysis demonstrates how digital twin accelerates supply chain productivity by improving makespan time, data redundancy (DR), optimal scheduling plan (OSP), overall operations effectiveness (OOE), overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), and capacity utilization. Our findings provide compelling evidence that the seamless integration PPDs enormously enhance production flexibility, resulting in an excellent service level of 94 %. Managers leverage real-time simulation to accurately estimate the replenishment point with minimal lead time, ensuring optimized operations. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that implementing PPDs has yielded considerable benefits. Specifically, we observed a remarkable 65 % utilization of the pasteurizer and aging vessel and an impressive 97 % utilization of the freezer. Moreover, by applying the DT model, the present model found a notable 6 % reduction in backlog, further streamlining operations and enhancing efficiency. © 2023 The Author(s)","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168753435"

The aim of this paper is to address this absence of a specialised application framework. The framework outlines multiple layers, dimensions, and stakeholder-technology dependencies for early-phase adoption. It is designed to guide planners and operators of supply chains in planning, implementing, and introducing new supply chain digital twins.

Using research from the literature, stakeholder analysis and a value proposition canvas, we reviewed technological innovations on the pharmacological level, formulation, validation and resilient vaccine production to supply bottlenecks and logistic networks. We identified four main drivers to accelerate the vaccine product life cycle: computerized candidate screening, modular production, digitized quality management and a resilient business model with corresponding transparent supply chains.

Despite the literature’s lack of a consistent definition, DTs have been applied to numerous areas as virtual replicas of physical objects, machines, or systems, particularly in manufacturing, production, and operations. One of the major advantages of digital twins is their ability to supervise the system’s evolution and run simulations, making them connected and capable of supporting decision-making. Additionally, they are highly compatible with artificial intelligence (AI) as they can be mapped to all data types and intelligence associated with the physical system. Given their potential benefits, it is surprising that the utilization of DTs for warehouse management has been relatively neglected over the years, despite its importance in ensuring supply chain and production uptime. Effective warehouse management is crucial for ensuring supply chain and production continuity in both manufacturing and retail operations. It also involves uncertain material handling operations, making it challenging to control the activity. This paper aims to evaluate the synergies between AI and digital twins as state-of-the-art technologies and examines warehouse digital twins’ (WDT) use cases to assess the maturity of AI applications within WDT, including techniques, objectives, and challenges. We also identify inconsistencies and research gaps, which pave the way for future development and innovation.

For decades, the abstraction on which this endogenous approach is based has provided a profound understanding of the job-shop scheduling problem and the static aspects characterizing it. Nowadays, it is worth highlighting the dynamic and interconnected nature of the contemporary job shop, a space where the design principles and enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 acquire a significant role. This paradigm provides the job shop with new opportunities to improve competitiveness through its digital transformation, but also poses a challenge with risks and barriers. From this interconnected digital job-shop perspective, the efficiency of its operations, including that of the job scheduling process, is critically conditioned by the interoperability between its own production resources and those of the entities in its intra- and supracompany environment that make up the value chain. This article studies the support that interoperability can specifically provide in the job-shop scheduling itinerary toward higher levels of automation, autonomy, and capacity for real-time action.

Complex production systems in rapidly changing environments result from product variation, shorter product life cycles, and supply chain expansion. A cyber-physical production system (CPPS) can use manufacturing and logistics data to plan, monitor, and control production. Discrete event simulation (DES) and digital twin (DT) technology can model and evaluate manufacturing and logistics processes using high-level decision support and process monitoring. The cost of collecting input data from different enterprise data sources and mapping it into models and the lack of qualified experts prevent the widespread use of these methods in industry, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises and larger multinational companies. This research aims to create a modular digital twin framework for manufacturing process optimization and real-time monitoring in an industrial environment with few components. The system can identify and track the product through the manufacturing cycle while updating the DT in real-time and can be used independently to collect input parameters for discrete event-driven simulations and even for automatic simulation building in the future. The framework's operation will be shown through an example. With the proposed IIoT (industrial internet of things) system integration, it can detect faults and warn of deviations from normal operation, and DT can drastically reduce data collection and model building and support model reusability, increasing sustainability.

The demand for circular products, the use of secondary materials in future vehicles, and the need for sustainable business models in the mobility sector is increasing. However, a transparent and end-to-end data exchange throughout the entire value network is missing, which is hindering an efficient circular economy. Relevant information on the vehicle, its components, and materials at the end of the product life cycle are often missing. In this context, this paper presents a decision support system based on Digital Twin data for a circular economy solution as a software application. It was developed within the German research project Catena-X following an integrated approach of user-centered design, the V-model, and within the Scaled Agile Framework. By combining these methodological approaches, customer-oriented solutions were developed and continuously improved at each stage of development to shorten the time-to-market. Catena-X is based on Gaia-X principles. In Gaia-X, necessary core services are developed, and contraction negotiation for data exchange and usage policies is enabled and implemented. The decision support system provides important information about the exact composition and condition of the vehicle, its components, and its materials. Thus, it helps to improve efficiency, sustainability, and the implementation of the circular economy. The decision support system was tested and validated with a use case that provided Digital Twin data on the end-of-life vehicle. © 2023 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159288496"

To this end, the movable factory concept has been put forward, which is defined as mobile production units that can be installed near the customer's location. Unfortunately, industrial paradigms such as Industry 4.0 make little if any notice of movable factories but instead focus on the digitalization of their fixed counterparts. In the form of a systematic literature review, this paper breaks down the concept of the movable factory, relates it to the state-of-the-art, and summarizes its main use cases, requirements, research gaps, and opportunities. The review covers over 100 relevant articles published in the past two decades. Compared to existing surveys, we have not only focused on the motivations for movable factories, but also identified research gaps and discuss the impact of modern technologies such as Internet-of-Things, digital twins, and modeling and simulation in fulfilling these gaps. The result is a survey of the state-of-the-art and a list of domains for potential future research on different aspects of movable factories. © 2023 The Author(s)","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163537832"

Recently, the logistics of vaccine supply under the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic rearouses public attention and calls for innovative solutions to tackle the challenges remaining in CCL. Accordingly, this study proposes a cyber-physical platform framework applying the Internet of Everything (IoE) and Digital Twin (DT) technologies to promote information integration and provide smart services for different stakeholders in the CCL. In the platform, reams of data are generated, gathered, and leveraged to interconnect and digitalize physical things, people, and processes in cyberspace, paving the way for digital servitization. Deep learning techniques are used for accident identification and indoor localization based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to actualize real-time staff safety supervision in the cold warehouse. Both algorithms are designed to take advantage of the IoE infrastructure to achieve online self-adapting in response to surrounding evolutions. Besides, with the help of mobile and desktop applications, paperless operation for shipment, remote temperature and humidity (T&H) monitoring, anomaly detection and warning, and customer interaction are enabled. Thus, information traceability and visibility are highly fortified in this way. Finally, a real-life case study is conducted in a pharmaceutical distribution center to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed platform and methods. The dedicated hardware and software are developed and deployed on site. As a result, the effectiveness of staff safety management, operational informatization, product quality assurance, and stakeholder loyalty maintenance shows a noticeable improvement.

The increasing demand for sustainable energy and the rise of the Metaverse has provided an opportunity to develop a secure and sustainable energy trading system using Smart Grid (SG), Virtual Power Plants (VPP), Digital Twins (DT), and Blockchain. Integrating VPP with SG can optimize the utilization of distributed energy resources and improve the stability and reliability of the energy supply in the metaverse. Meanwhile, the use of DT can facilitate the efficient management of VPPs by simulating their behavior and performance to identify potential issues and test different scenarios for improvement. Blockchain is a rising technology that enables decentralized and trustworthy applications, making it a promising tool for creating decentralized energy trading systems in the Metaverse. In this context, we propose Next-Power, a next-generation framework for secure and sustainable energy trading in the Metaverse. Next-Power consists of: (1) an automated blockchain-based fair payment of energy traded between consumers and prosumers in the Metaverse, it uses Ethereum's smart contracts to determine the price at which energy is traded using a cooperative game theory (i.e., reverse auction); (2) an access token-based blockchain system that ensures a secure mutual authentication between consumers and prosumers; and (3) a lightweight on-chain collaborative reputation scheme that keeps track of prosumers reputation as well as consumers credibility in the Metaverse in a fully decentralized manner. The system of Next-Power is implemented, tested, and deployed on the Ethereum official test network. Next-Power is a promising framework for the future of energy trading in the Metaverse, as demonstrated by its successful experimental results in terms of flexibility, efficiency, security, and cost-effectiveness. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166639603"

Real-time data analytics builds up traceability and visibility, not only in the physical domain but also cyber space. This paper adds a new concept of cyber-physical inventory or simply meta-inventory to Industry 4.0 CPPS. In addition to physical items, their digital twins are considered as part of production inventory. Traceability and visibility enabled by digital twin can significantly reduce complexity and uncertainties (e.g. lead times and variability) while achieving resilience in case of major disturbances. The CPPS factory hedges the risks through meta-inventory without incurring cost for holding inventory digitally. After reflecting upon the developments of production inventory management corresponding to the evolutionary history of manufacturing systems to Industry 4.0, the paper presents the meta-inventory paradigm within a simple Industry 4.0 compliant supply chain. The factory, the supplier, and the transport implement a VMI (vendor-managed inventory) strategy. Two well-known basic EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) and EPQ (Economic Production Quantity or production Lot Sizing) problems are extended to demonstrate and quantify the impacts of using meta-inventory on the supply chain and the member enterprise. The analyses allow us to unfold key perspectives in more complex production and supply chain systems for further research. © 2022","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143508552"

This work aims to solve supply chain interruption caused by public health emergencies in real life through the resilient supply chain based on digital twins (DTs). The research example used here is the disruption of the supply chain of N95 medical masks under the COVID-19 epidemic. First, the resilient supply chain's emergency decision cost and profit model is established under the manufacturer-supplier shared mode. The supply chain of M company of N95 medical masks in Hubei under the COVID-19 pandemic is selected to discuss the cost of emergency decision-making in the resilient supply chain. Moreover, a product supply chain model is built, including H suppliers, J manufacturers, K distributors, and L retailers. Supply failures result in lower supplier capacity ratios. Accordingly, the supply chain will adopt emergency strategies to reduce operating costs and increase profits. Activating alternative suppliers and distributors can mitigate the loss caused by partial supply chain disruption in emergencies. The elasticity of supply chains based on DTs discussed here is of significant value in helping the automation of critical links of the supply chain. The resilient supply chain combined with the capacity recovery strategy can significantly improve the traditional supply chain's response to supply disruption events.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136890957"

While there has been an increasing research interest in the development of such passports, there is, to the best of our knowledge, no well-formed, common definition and explanation of the concept itself. This also reflects in the various alternative terminology used to indicate this phenomenon (product passport, material passport, resource passport, recycling passport, cradle-to-cradle passport, etc.). A unified understanding of a concept, its components, variables and relationships would however contribute toward more precise communication of research ideas, findings and discussions about such passport development. Using a descriptive research approach, we aim to study this field in order to formalize the concept. This work points out, that many of the passport variants, pursue a similar goal and have similar characteristics and contextual challenges. Based on the similarities and conceptual boundaries identified, we suggest that these passports can best be defined as a digital interface composing a certified identity of a single identifiable product by accessing the set of life cycle registrations linked to this object in order to yield insight into the sustainability and circularity characteristics, the circular value estimation, and the circular opportunities for both that product and its underlying components and materials.

As with other facets of life, it is thoroughly digitalized, and uses network connections. Consequently, the cyber security of the supply chain becomes a major concern as new threats emerge. Cyber ranges can be used to prepare for such cyber security threats by creating realistic scenarios mimicking real-world systems and setups. Organizations can participate in cyber security training and exercises that present them with these scenarios. Cyber ranges can also be used efficiently for research and development activities, because cyber ranges are realistic environments and can be used for the generation of realistic data. The aim of this study is to describe a digital twin of the food supply chain built for cyber range-based cyber security exercises. The digital twin mirrors the real-world situation with sufficient detail, as required by the cyber exercise. This research uses the design science methodology, which describes the construction and evaluation of the proposed system. The study explains the general capabilities of the food supply chain digital twin and its use in the cyber range environment. Different parts of the supply chain are implemented as Node.js services that run on the Realistic Global Cyber Environment (RGCE) platform. The flow of ingredients and products is simulated using an apparatus model and message queues. The digital twin was demonstrated in a real live cyber exercise. The results indicate that the apparatus approach was a scalable and realistic enough way to implement the digital twin. The main limitations of the implemented system are the implementation on one specific platform, and the need for more feedback from multiple exercises. Creation of a digital twin enables the use of cyber ranges to train organizations related to the food supply chain. © 2023 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163955452"

In this paper, Open Supply Chain Management (OSCM) is conceptualized as a new paradigm in the evolution of SCM. Companies can benefit from integrated physical and conceptual resources to promote efficiency and flexibility throughout the supply chain's main processes, including supplying, manufacturing, distributing, and marketing. The OSCM concept is undergoing several drivers including crowdsourcing, open innovation, Industry 4.0, cloud manufacturing, Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and the digital twin that appeared in the last decades. To validate OSCM in practice, a subset of this concept is investigated to incorporate the designing process with supply chain production planning applying a digital twin network. Additionally, dealing with epistemic uncertainty, a fuzzy tactical planning model is developed, and to study the developed model in more detail, an industrial study in the clothes manufacturing industry is employed. The results illustrate that the products' designing cost consists of only 2% of the supply chain total cost. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122277063"

As a side-effect, Industry 4.0 technologies are disruptively reshaping, under the threefold Triple Bottom Line perspective, supply chains and different contexts such as innovation management and societal development. The eleven papers published in this special issue aim at contributing to the emerging research stream about the sustainable development of I4.0-CE-driven supply chains. In particular, four main macro-topics emerged: (i) I4.0-driven Circular Supply Chains (CSCs); (ii) Life Cycle Information in CE ecosystems; (iii) Waste management process optimisation; (iv) Drivers, challenges, opportunities, and barriers for I4.0-CE-driven supply chains. In the studies included in this special issue collection, novel conceptual frameworks and methodologies are proposed, and some practical cases are also conducted, promoting relevant advances in the twofold field of I4.0-CE, triggering the green and digital twin transition towards a supply chain and social dimension. Nevertheless, the analysis of the papers constituting the special issue reveals promising research opportunities necessary to investigate and explore this emerging domain in its specific facets. More quantitative studies are needed to understand better the dynamics in CSC, CE ecosystems and Industrial Symbiosis networks. Finally, developing specialised circular and sustainable technologies based on intelligent architectures and adopting data-driven approaches could support the adoption of circular practices not only within the companies but also outside them in the CSC and social dimensions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","","Editorial","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168837756"

We address this gap by investigating multi-agent system approaches for implementing autonomous supply chains, presenting an autonomous economic agent-based technical framework. We illustrate this framework with a prototype, studied in a perishable food supply chain scenario, and discuss possible extensions. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Digital twin in the food supply chain can enhance the resilience of food supply chain, reduce the food waste, and improve the sustainability. The purpose of this research is to identify and analyze the role of digital twin technology in enhancing the resilience and sustainability of food supply chain. The novel grey causal modelling (GCM) methodology has been utilized in this research for analysis. The GCM for the causal analysis can consider the four features that are characterized as the causes, the effects, the objectives, and the outcomes. This research work has identified the fifteen factors from the extant literature review and experts’ opinions. The responses are collected from the experts in two phases. In the first phase, responses were taken to find the cause-and-effect factors, and in second phase, responses were collected to rank the identified cause-effect pairs for various objectives to calculate the outcomes for the study. The various situations were plotted based on their outcomes with respect to objectives using the magnitude plots. Findings of the study suggest that enhanced coordination is the decisive causal factor, considering the dual objectives of resilience and sustainability.

In this paper, we first present Product, Process, and Data quality services to drive zero-waste value chain strategies. Following this, we present the Trusted Framework (TF), which is a key enabler for the secure and effective sharing of quality-related information within the supply chain business ecosystem, and thus for quality optimization actions towards zero-defect manufacturing.

In the presented Smart Forestry approach, we apply concepts from Forestry 4.0 to achieve intelligent and fully integrated timber harvesting. It is based on digital twins that are networked and orchestrated in an Internet of Things. First, we reengineer existing forestry processes, identify the relevant objects and messages, and specify templates for digital twins.

Deriving from information and communication technologies and artificial intelligence, the digital twin shop-floor (DTS) has received great attention from academia and industry. DTS is a virtual shop-floor that is almost identical to the physical shop-floor. Therefore, multiple physical shop-floors located in different places can easily be interconnected to realize a DT that is a distributed digital twin shop-floor (D2TS). However, some challenges still hinder effective and efficient resource allocation among D2TSs. In order to attempt to address the issues, firstly, this paper proposes an information architecture for D2TSs based on cloud–fog computing; secondly, a novel mechanism of D2TS resource allocation (D2TSRA) is designed. The proposed mechanism both makes full use of a digital twin to support dynamic allocation of geographic resources and avoids the centralized solutions of the digital twin which lead to a heavy burden on the network bandwidth; thirdly, the optimization problem in D2TSRA is solved by a BP neural network algorithm and an improved genetic algorithm; fourthly, a case study for distributed collaborative manufacturing of aero-engine casing is employed to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method of resource allocation for D2TS; finally, the paper is summarized and the relevant research directions are prospected. © 2023 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168760181"

Ad-hoc recovery actions usually imply expensive air transport, which produces higher CO2 emissions, to compensate for material shortages and avoid production stops. Despite the large variety of methods developed to improve resilience in supply chains, literature is silent about the environmental impact of recovery strategies. Through a simulation-based analysis using the anyLogistix digital supply chain model, we examine the impact of two sustainable recovery strategies – additive manufacturing and electric trucks – on supply chain environmental and resilience performance. We demonstrate that the proposed strategies allow recovery sustainability to be improved as compared to ad-hoc reactions with high CO2 emissions. Our findings contribute to the literature on supply chain resilience by extending the existing knowledge on the trade-offs between resilience and sustainability in line with the Industry 5.0 framework toward building sustainable resilience. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165675873"

These standalone or networked EVCSs open up large attack surfaces for local or state-funded adversaries. The state-of-the-art approaches are not agile and intelligent enough to defend against and mitigate advanced persistent threats (APT). We propose data-driven model-free digital clones based on multiple independent agents deep reinforcement learning (IADRL) that uses the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) to efficiently learn the control policy to mitigate the cyberattacks on the controllers of EVCS. Also, the proposed digital clones trained with TD3 are compared against the benchmark Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent. The attack model considers the APT designed to malfunction the duty cycles of the EVCS controllers with Type-I low-frequency attacks and Type-II constant attacks. The proposed model restores the EVCS operation under threat incidence in any/all controllers by correcting the control signals generated by the legacy controllers. Our experiments verify the superior control policies and actions of TD3-based clones compared to the DDPG-based clones. Also, the TD3-based controller clones solve the problem of incremental bias, suboptimal policy, and hyperparameter sensitivity of the benchmark DDPG-based digital clones, enforcing the efficient mitigation of the impact of cyberattacks on EVCS controllers. © 2023 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176466362"

While many papers in this area focus on technical tactics and learnings, this research paper aims to evaluate its business implications. According to literature, it has also been a weakly covered topic. Design/methodology/approach: The research was conducted as a single case study, in which the impact of radio-frequency identification–enabled DT was quantified from the business benefits perspective. The evaluation was carried out using a framework model developed for the assessment identifying key contribution areas and the dynamics explaining how the benefits are expected to land on a business level. Findings: Implementation of the DT was calculated to provide a significant supply chain performance improvement. The main contributor in the immediate benefits was the reduction in supply chain costs, in person-hours. However, the product availability improvement was conservatively considered in the evaluation, and thus, this paper estimates that it, together with higher cognition tools, constitutes the main financial return in the long run showing in the topline improvement. This paper suggests that the shift to DT can be generally limited by the cost savings perspective. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first studies released on the business impact of the cutting-edge technical solution area of the DT in supply chain management. In practice, businesses require an understanding of the business implications to decide on the investments in this area; thus, it is a critical part of the discussion. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124187419"

Past DT research explored facility management and fault detection, highlighting a knowledge gap on the use of DT for smart construction and emissions monitoring in prefabrication supply chain (PSC). Therefore, the aim of this study is to present a holistic view of DT applications in PSC by exploring real-time smart construction and carbon emissions monitoring. A mixed-method review was adopted in two-steps involving scientometric and qualitative analysis in this study. Findings from the scientometric analysis revealed high interest in research themes such as emissions and energy control, artificial intelligence-based decision-making and blockchain integration in DT for prefabrication. Furthermore, the findings from the qualitative analysis demonstrated how smart technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID), global positioning systems (GPS), laser scanners and sensors have been employed at the production, transportation, and on-site assembly stages of PSC for buildings. For real-time carbon emissions monitoring in DT, this study revealed various smart technologies and their corresponding information requirements for materials/components, machinery, and processes at each stage of the PSC. Five future research directions were provided on effective ways to advance DT in PSC for intelligent building processes and monitor emissions. Therefore, this study not only shows smart technologies suitable for DT in PSC, but also contributes to knowledge on using DT to monitor real-time carbon emissions in PSC for buildings. This study would aid researchers and practitioners with systemic approaches to employ when applying DT in PSC. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172423350"

Simultaneously, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) evaluation appeared in the business and government to tackle sustainable development issues. Therefore, how to effectively govern the cold chain logistics service providers (CCLSPs) to perform better in ESG evaluation becomes an interesting research topic. This paper systematically analyzes the influence of digital twin service (DTS) on ESG evaluation and analytically investigates the long-term behavior of sustainability concerned stakeholders in the VLSC. Firstly, an architecture of DTS enabled ESG evaluation for VLSC is proposed to describe the DTS effectiveness. After that, a tripartite evolutionary game model in a two-tiered VLSC including CCLSPs, the public, and government regulators is proposed. And the conditions for the existence of equilibrium stable points are derived to capture the feature of the government incentives and the role of the public in the DTS investment decisions of CCLSPs. The governance mechanisms, such as the enactment of penalty and bonus, are discussed for facilitating the DTS investment in the VLSC to improve the ESG evaluation of CCLSPs. The association of the factors is validated by using analytical sensitivity analysis. The results manifest that government oversight will promote ESG improvement in the logistics market equipped with DTS. The public will be the driving force behind the refusal of CCLSPs to invest in DTS. It is evident that DTS can offer better solutions for the improvement of ESG assessment for VLSC with different strategic stakeholders. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162013543"

As a matter of fact, inefficient management and scarce resources significantly impeded the development of sustainability. In recent years, it has been observed that the digital twin (DT) technology plays a promising role in facilitating the interaction between the Internet of Things (IoT) assets and digital services. However, high-fidelity models of DTs raise the requirement of efficient data flows, which is limited by realistic constraints, such as data collection strategy and energy supply. We propose a sustainable data collection and management approach to construct DTs for physical assets. With this approach, data packets are uploaded to the data brokers, namely, agents, by a large number of IoT devices. The challenge lies in the balance between enduring data collection and the information loss associated with the stale data. In this article, we aim to optimize the metrics of data fidelity and reveal delay while guaranteeing both sustainable energy and sustainable information. Additionally, a shareable and sustainable blockchain-based DT management architecture is proposed, which does not rely on data exchanges with a single centralized server. Our analytical and simulation results demonstrate the applicability of our proposed architecture.  © 2014 IEEE.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125298877"

When coupled with recent developments in machine learning (ML), DTs have the potential to generate invaluable insights for process manufacturing companies to help them optimize their manufacturing processes. However, this potential has yet to be fully exploited due to the challenges that process manufacturing companies face in developing and implementing DTs in their organizations. Although DTs are receiving increasing attention in both industry and academia, there is limited literature on how to apply them in the process industry. To address this gap, this paper presents a framework for developing ML-based DTs to predict critical process parameters in real time. The proposed framework is tested through a case study at an international process manufacturing company in which it was used to collect and process plant data, build accurate predictive models for two critical process parameters, and develop a DT application to visualize the models’ predictions. The case study demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed DT–ML framework in the sense that it provided the company with more accurate predictions than the models it previously applied. The study provides insights into the value of applying ML-based DT in the process industry and sheds light on some of the challenges associated with the application of this technology. © 2023 The Authors","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164238444"

New digital and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies allow to develop novel approaches and tools in this area for the transition from standalone models to intelligent decision-support systems (DSSs). However, the literature lacks concepts and guidelines for the design of such systems. In this paper, we offer a generalized decision-making framework for using digital twins in SC stress-testing and resilience analysis as well as delineate how digital twins can contribute to theory development in SC resilience and viability. We position our proposed approach as an intelligent digital twin (iDT) – a human–AI system which visualizes physical SCs in digital form, collects and processes data for modelling using analytics methods, mimics human decision-making rules, and creates new knowledge and decision-making algorithms through human–AI collaboration. We conclude that the iDT supports monitoring, disruption prediction (early signals), event-driven responses, learning, and proactive thinking, integrating proactive and reactive approaches to SC resilience. The iDT helps to make the unknown known and so contributes to the development of a proactive, adaptation-based view on SC resilience and viability.

Numerous supply chain challenges such as forecasting issues, maintaining traditional inventories, distribution delays, delayed digital transformation, counterfeit consumer goods, excessive carbon gas emissions, and hazardous waste have necessitated improvements in supply chain management. These difficulties can only be addressed by modernizing the embedded technology of the supply chain. According to current assessments, organizations should prioritize sustainable development and use innovations such as the “Internet of Things (IoT) and big data” to create smart and resilient supply chains for sustainable performance and Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0, ushers in a sustainable and digital supply chain revolution through the application of cutting-edge technologies. The 19 papers in this special issue aim to contribute to the development of research topics on optimizing the IoT and big data-embedded smart supply chains for sustainable performance. Three major macro-topics arose: (i) Implication of IoT in Supply Chain, (ii) impact of big data in the supply chain, and (iii) Use of Blockchain in Supply Chain Analysis. Novel evidence-based frameworks and approaches have been proposed, as well as some real-life situations, in the articles featured in this special issue collection, supporting meaningful developments in the twin subject of IoT and Big data-embedded smart supply chains for sustainable performance. Nonetheless, an examination of the papers in the special issue reveals interesting research prospects required to analyze and explore this developing topic in terms of its various features. More evidence and application-based research are required to better understand the dynamics of Smart Supply Chains for Sustainable Performance ecosystems and Industrial Symbiosis networks. Finally, specialized IoT and Big data are being developed. Embedded solutions based on intelligent architectures and data-driven techniques can help firms embrace Smart Supply Chains for Sustainable Performance not only within their own walls, but also in the supply chain and societal dimensions. © 2023","","Editorial","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179968520"

As a complement and extension to the technology-driven premises of Industry 4.0, the value-driven Industry 5.0 focuses on society and the environment. Human centricity, sustainability, and resilience should become a more integral part of both industrial and societal revolutions. One of the enabler technologies for both is the Digital Twin (DT). In order to make DTs intelligent, they must become active, online, goal-seeking, and anticipatory. To meet these requirements, the characteristics of Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) can be employed. This paper contributes to the bilateral emergence of the two industrial paradigms and establishes an approach for the provision of Intelligent Digital Twins (IDTs) within the Internet of Digital Twins (IoDT). Initially, a DT reference model aligned with already established Industry 4.0 reference models enriched with the goals of Industry 5.0 is developed, followed by an outline of how IDTs can be realized with the characteristics of MAS. The work is substantiated by an architectural design for IDTs choreographing marketplace-oriented production processes with a subsequent prototypical implementation, followed by a proof of concept. © 2023 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160575004"

Findings from evaluation demonstrate the potential of our proposed model. Specifically, our algorithm reduces time and energy consumption of EIG algorithm in consensus by 46.84% and 16.25%, respectively.

By refrigeration, they ensure that food quality is better preserved and food losses are reduced. Countries that produce fresh produce also unlock new markets for export through refrigerated container transport. Scope and approach: The authors have worked in the research and development of reefer-facilitated supply chains for over two decades. Based on our research and engineering work with key stakeholders, we provide our perspective on how the industry will or should evolve. We also elaborate on upcoming trends and key bottlenecks the industry faces. This paper touches upon subjects relevant to the global fruit and vegetable trade. These topics involve (1) the fresh produce reefer market, (2) the climate inside the reefer, including temperature uniformity and controlled atmosphere trends, (3) sustainability aspects such as greenhouse gas emissions and potential energy savings, and (4) the move towards smart reefers and the use of digital food twins. Key findings: We particularly encourage more research on using a controlled atmosphere to save energy and better preserve foods, the effectiveness of ethylene scrubbers in reefers, synergizing the data acquisition pipelines of different sensor systems, and integrating these data with other parts of the supply chain into one data ecosystem. Conclusions: As future trends, we foresee a further reduction of the carbon footprint and developments in digital twins of the refrigerated container and its cargo to monitor and predict future fruit and vegetable quality during transit and beyond. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","","Note","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169563514"

An enterprise e-profile is enterprise model data that describes an enterprise's outline, characteristics, dynamic activity as behavior, etc. in a common understandable manner. An enterprise e-profile can be converted into a virtual enterprise (software agent) as a member of a network. When configuring a business-to-business collaborative network in cyberspace, by constructing a virtual network as a multi-agent system, it is possible to search the appropriate cooperation partner, to consider the appropriate action of oneself and so on. In other words, an enterprise e-profile will act as name card of the company in the cyber business world.

Products’ innate susceptibility to spoilage, unexpected issues, and shifting conditions post-strategy commencement are among the manifold reasons for distribution strategy failure in the food supply chain (FSC). Dynamically optimised distribution (DOD) methods can help distribution strategies to adapt and respond to unforeseen changes in today’s complex, connected and interdependent FSC. Building on Digital Twins (DTs) superior connectivity and actuation capabilities, this paper proposes a new DT-based method for DOD in the FSC, from DT design to modelling and evaluation in AnyLogic. Initial simulation results from a UK-based case study show that DT-enabled DOD could bring savings of more than £25,000 in direct costs and 150 tonnes of CO2 per shipment in a typical 20-tonne transport refrigeration unit (TRU). Benefits are compounded by potential fuel savings of up 132 L per year and TRU due to DT-enabled DOD dynamic carrier re-routing capabilities. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172722496"

Maintaining optimal storage conditions for perishable food products during transportation is vital. This paper introduces a cost-effective and reliable solution for mapping the temperature distribution profile inside refrigerated containers during transportation, aimed at mitigating food losses. The research employs a Grey Box approach, integrating both White Box (comprehensive system knowledge) and Black Box (data-driven) methods. Three distinct models, including neural networks, XGBoost, and random forest, are trained with data from numerical simulations of the reefer container during transportation. Results reveal that the random forest model outperforms the others, displaying minimal errors in various evaluation metrics. The discrepancies between predicted and actual values are visualized, confirming the model's reliability. This research provides a practical solution for monitoring and controlling environmental conditions within reefer containers. The model can be generalized by implementing and validating it with temperature data from other perishable supply chains. Furthermore, the model can undergo testing and validation using continuously streamed real-time temperature data, ultimately leading to the development of a digital twin model. © 2023 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186744971"

To ensure the food quality and safety of cold chain logistics warehouses, and achieve cost reduction and efficiency improvement, this study focuses on the operational scenarios of stereo warehouses in cold chain logistics, and designs a five-dimensional digital twin model with full mapping and multidimensional simulation. By integrating heterogeneous data from multiple sources, it achieves real-time visualization and monitoring of all elements in warehouses, and proposes a model optimization strategy that supports system-linked decision-making. This strategy intelligently adjusts the load and thermal distribution in the temperature-controlled zones of warehouses to maximize operational efficiency and reduce operating costs. Using this approach, a digital twin system for cold chain logistics warehouses was constructed. By comparing the warehouse operation data before and after optimization, the loss rate of fresh vegetables under the same storage conditions was reduced by 25-30%. This system achieves precise mapping and coordinated operation of real-time data from cold chain logistics warehouses and dynamic virtual models. The practical application of this solution is demonstrated in a cold-chain warehouse of a supply chain company in Guangdong, forming an integrated control model for cold chain logistics warehouses. This model provides a reference for the application of digital twin technology in the operation, scheduling, decision-making, and collaborative operations of cold chain logistics warehouses and offers new possibilities for establishing improved packaging for perishable products and ensuring cold chain food quality and safety.  © 2013 IEEE.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165241219"

A lack of technology makes the ready-mix concrete (RMC) industry suffer from frequent production failures, ultimately causing high customer dissatisfaction and loss of revenues. In this paper, we propose the first-ever digital twin (DT) system in the RMC industry that can serve as a decision support tool to manage production risk efficiently and effectively via predictive maintenance. This study focuses on the feasibility of digital twins for the RMC industry in three main areas holistically: (1) the technical feasibility of the digital twin system for ready-mix concrete plant production risk management; (2) the business value of the proposed product to the construction industry; (3) the challenges of implementation in the real-world RMC industry. The proposed digital twin system consists of three main phases: (1) an IoT system to get the real-time production cycle times; (2) a digital twin operational working model with descriptive analytics; (3) an advanced analytical dashboard with predictive analytics to make predictive maintenance decisions. Our proposed digital twin solution can provide efficient and interpretable predictive maintenance insights in real time based on anomaly detection, production bottleneck identification, process disruption forecast and cycle time analysis. Finally, this study emphasizes that state-of-the-art solutions such as digital twins can effectively manage the production risks of ready-mix concrete plants by automatically detecting and predicting the bottlenecks without waiting until a production failure happens to react. © 2023 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149203304"

As a Tier 1, Spirit needs to be able to consume and work with any and all engineering data (e.g., Computer Aided Design (CAD), Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) information, schedule, etc.) regardless of the toolset initially used to develop the data. Significant challenges Spirit faces are the method and content of data exchange, and the interface definition enabling the exchange of information with an OEM. Digital Transformation initiatives throughout industry seek to compress the production lifecycle by staging information as early in the lifecycle as possible. For the OEM, the interface and early data exchange are easily addressed by simply providing the suppliers with access to the OEM’s engineering design system. However, this limits the ability of the supplier to fully experience the “shift left” concept for the production lifecycle. The ability to extend the Digital Thread/Twin into the Tier 1 supply base from the OEM, allowing effective and efficient development from the program initiation is the focus of this effort. The capability starts with MBSE through detail design, manufacturing, delivery, and how to support OEM Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) through the life of the product. © 2023, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

However, research shows that actual use of digital twins is sparse, with adoption rates struggling to surpass 10% in most industries. Arguably the biggest reason for this lack of traction is a similar lack of sufficient digitization across companies and industries. The fact is, organizations’ slow pace in digital transformation means the digital foundation necessary for digital twins to thrive is still lacking in most companies and industries, although front-runners and laggards are beginning to emerge. Simply put, digital maturity must increase substantially for companies to fully benefit from them. When this happens, digital twin adoption should accelerate rapidly, and companies will begin to see how digital twins can play a crucial role in their efforts to create greater operational resilience; optimize supply chain networks, processes, and inventory; and foster bigger strides toward sustainability. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170164305"

Therefore, it is necessary to conduct sufficient research on the market and user needs before setting the framework of digital twins for industrial symbiosis. We interviewed six companies in the Norwegian wood industry that could potentially share one symbiosis network. Based on the interviews, we analyzed the needs of potential digital twins for industrial symbiosis, aiming to understand the user’s point of view on digital twins for industrial symbiosis. The research is expected to provide intellectual support for future digital twins’ design from the user perspective.

Real-time optimization of O&G production value chain (ROOPVC) can be used to achieve the above-described objectives. Specifically, ROOPVC allows for i) integration of various elements of the O&G production value chain to create a single reference truth of the system, ii) prediction of unified behavior of the single reference truth using physics-based models and data-driven algorithms, and iii) holistic optimization via single unified digital twin (DT). Based on recent advances, this study reviews system-level and component-level technologies required to implement ROOPVC. Specifically, the study reviews in detail the two major elements of ROOPVC, which are i) DT technology and ii) modeling, simulation, and optimization, respectively. The study also summarizes field experiences in the deployment of ROOPVC. The key challenges, lessons learned, and recommendations for the deployment of ROOPVC are also discussed. The major findings from this review suggest that ROOPVC i) can enable higher stable production while simultaneously allowing significant carbon savings, ii) is suitable for deployment on a field of any size, and iii) can be deployed quickly due to its modular (microservices) approach.

The technical foundations for Digital Twins start with deep domain knowledge in the area of application and fundamentally rely on information and operation technologies. A key ingredient is the unrelenting trend to recast stand-alone mechanical systems with digitally analogs where operations are data driven and managed through sophisticated digital control systems. The consequence is a remarkable explosion of performance improvements and new functionality. The enablers are the emergence of computing power that is inherently distributed and widely available, the virtualization of previously mechanical functions and processes through software, and the hyperconnectivity of organizations, the products, and devices they provide, and consumers. What is new and exciting is the use of Digital Twins to understand the dynamics and flows in complex systems by creating a Metaverse where it is possible to explore actions and decisions faster than real time The successful implementation strategy for Digital Twins relies just as much on human and organizational factors as it does on the technology. The important aspects of this are committed leadership, development of human capabilities, tools and infrastructure within the enterprise, increased reliance on collaboration within a greater ecosystem, and the realignment of corporate structures to take advantage of new business models and new capabilities. The Chapter illustrates these points in four different areas: supply chains, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. Because missteps are more than possible the Chapter also addresses the precautions to take in implementing Digital Twins. To be competitive and to thrive now and in tomorrow’s world Digital Twins are an important concept for organizations to internalize and an imperative to put into practice now. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170168467"

Due to the closely net-worked trade relations unpredictable events like pandemics, natural disasters, technical disruptions of supply chains and political conflicts can have considerable economic and social consequences. However, the central point is the constantly and rapidly changing market conditions to which it is necessary to react, or which must be shaped in order to adequately and successfully counter new technologies or new competitors. Within this paper it is worked out that based on targeted support of decision makers from top management to lower management and of the executing staff, the economic consequences for companies can be lowered with data-driven approaches and furthermore the. The objective of this paper is to help tackling reconfiguration needs via a holistic approach with the human being in the centre.

Developments in technology, the increase in computer power and the reduction of cost, has allowed for greater accessibility, use and implementation of this technology in all sectors and industries. The evolution of smart and autonomous technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, has enabled traditionally labour intensive data analytical tasks to be conducted, quickly and efficiently. Multiple datasets and data lakes that have been siloed, are now being utilised and interconnected. Digital twin, AI, metaverse, virtual technologies are being immersed into all sectors and more importantly merged into humans where the line between reality and virtual are seeming to be the same. However, in order to succeed utilising these amazing and emerging technologies, it means that there has to be an incredible backbone and capacity to carry data; and instantaneously delivery at high speed and securely. 5G is already in its rollout and has to achieve its objectives in order for 6G to be fully onboarded and implemented in a methodical manner. The European Commission has 5G objectives and is applying funding for strategic initiatives, such as Horizon 2020. There are huge benefits for all with 5G/6G but only if they are implemented in a manner that decreases the risk they can pose to security, privacy and trust, which are core pillars that must be maintained. Smart cities will mean the data that is being collected can be analysed and in the wrong hands it poses security risks to the data/individual/nation. With such an intertwining of technologies interacting with humans and the abundance of IoT and eIoT in smart cities, there has to be a clear governance plan in place and way to manage 5G/6G to ensure success. This chapter explains the 5G/6G background, risks, benefits and highlights the need for robust governance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169030088"

Production research has focused on sophisticated mathematical models ranging from molecular materials modeling to production control to supply chain logistics. These models help simulate and control the related physical system but the variety of individual situations and behaviors is captured only as statistical uncertainty. The emergence of data-driven methods adds statistical or AI models learned from real-time production data to Digital Twins, and ideally allows for continuous synchronization (twinning) between physical and virtual system. However, the complexity of today's production systems precludes Digital Twins covering more than just a few system perspectives, especially if realtime performance is required. To achieve better performance and more precise context adaptation, the interdisciplinary research cluster “Internet of Production” at RWTH Aachen University is exploring the concept of Digital Shadows. We conceptualize Digital Shadows as a generalization of compact views on dynamic processes, whose defining “query” combines condensed measurement data with efficient simplified mathematical models. Their small size makes Digital Shadows amenable to dynamic function allocation in hybrid cloud–edge settings. In addition to showing the similarities and differences to the traditional view concept, we also present a conceptual embedding of Digital Shadows in the context of large distributed system architectures, and sovereign data exchange in international Data Space communities. Two production use case experiences demonstrate that Digital Shadows can be valuable carriers of deep and reusable engineering knowledge for technical and ecological progress. © 2023 The Author(s)","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147195669"

Using elements of a structured literature search and building on the concepts of cyber-physical systems, digital supply chain twins, cloud supply chains, and Industry 4.0/Industry 5.0, we propose a framework for metaverse SCOM encompassing multiple socio-technological dimensions. We conclude that further metaverse developments could result in a co-existence of physical SCOM, metaverse SCOM, and SCOM for coordination of the physical and metaverse worlds. We offer a structured future research agenda pointing to new research questions and topics stemming from metaverse-driven visibility, computational power for data analytics, digital collaboration, and connectivity. New research areas can emerge for the novel metaverse SCOM processes and decision-making areas (e.g. joint demand forecasting for metaverse and physical products, digital inventory allocation in the metaverse, integrated production planning for the metaverse and physical worlds, and pricing and contracting for digital products), as well as new performance measures (e.g. virtual customer experience level, availability of digital products, and digital resilience and sustainability). © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166662816"

This virtual prototype which allows the company to visualize the status and condition of a clothing product that may be thousands of kilometers away, providing insights into how products can be better designed, manufactured, operated and serviced before companies invest in physical prototypes and assets, is often called digital twin. At the same time, laser-cut as a creative design technique on clothing materials have emerged in recent times, as fashion moguls are seeing the benefits that the technology presents. Laser cut technology with its benefits of accuracy, speed, precision, applicability in various materials, flexibility in geometry, interoperability with other systems like CAD/CAM and CIM, sustainability in resources and source of inspiration for several upcoming designers, provides an excellent approach for creating bridges between the past, the present and the future in history of fashion design. The aim of this paper was to provide a decision-making framework for the selection of an effective digital twinning process with the use of two different 3D virtual prototyping tools. For this purpose, a methodological framework is proposed which guides the creator according to the final use of the digital garment twin: evaluation of actual fit and actual representation of the produced physical, or as a shared digital asset for an exclusive digital environment. © The Author(s) 2023.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169702261"

The Building Safety Act 2022 introduces the ‘golden thread’ of building information which means that finding the truth of a product’s provenance is never more needed than now – and reinforcing steel is one of the most safety critical structural materials in any project. De-sign and structural engineers also need to understand the environmental impact of their designs and in particular, the upfront ‘embodied’ carbon emissions – measured as its Global Warming Potential (GWP) in CO2 equivalent (CO2e) per tonne of product. This paper outlines how a Cloud-based digital solution was developed to address and solve these urgent issues, bringing simplicity to a complex supply chain while restoring trust where it is missing. The digital platform provides a secure system of product provenance – and traceability – from the design stage, through to the ‘as-built digital twin’ including all data required to meet current and future safety, quality and sustainability regulations. It uses customisable dashboards and a suite of Apps to allow online and hand-held scanners and smartphones to trace what has been manufactured, procured, fabricated and delivered in real-time. It replaces existing manual paper-based processes which are labour intensive and vulnerable to damage or malicious alteration and potentially leave significant gaps in assurance trails. There are further benefits such as productivity improvements by reducing time and cost, accurate as-built CO2e accounting, reducing reinforcing steel wastage, data sharing and integration, visible assured supply chain assurance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164266702"

Considering the immature technology of CO2 pipeline long-distance transmission and the lack of relevant utilization technologies, it is necessary to develop a reproducible and efficient CCUS digital system. The research shows that different concentrations of CO2 have a promotion mechanism for plants in photosynthesis. On this basis, through various sensors, actuators and intelligent twin platforms, the problems of poor information communication and extensive management of CCUS in all aspects of agricultural application can be solved, giving new answers to the low-cost CO2 pipeline transportation and utilization of CCUS technology at the emerging stage. In this study, through the introduction of artificial intelligence and digital twin related technologies, the data of farmland soil physical and chemical properties are collected by using nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, conductivity, PH value, temperature, humidity and other sensors, and the impact of exogenous carbon dioxide on plant photosynthesis, plant physiology and biochemistry, and plant growth yield is comprehensively analyzed. The demand for carbon dioxide is predicted through artificial intelligence technology, and carbon capture is conducted according to the prediction results, The carbon dioxide sensor can accurately measure the concentration and content of captured carbon dioxide; The captured carbon dioxide will be timely and accurately distributed to the corresponding farmland for soil improvement and crop yield increase. Visual modeling of the above process can visually see the overall operation process online. This research combines the virtual and real aspects of CCUS, and realizes the accurate evaluation, standardized management, visual real-time early warning, personalized analysis, intelligent decision-making and fine control of the whole process of agricultural CCUS supply chain. It has improved the intelligence and informatization level of the supply chain, as well as the intelligent service capability and circulation efficiency. In the future, we will modularize the components used in the above process to facilitate personalized configuration according to customer needs. © 2023, Scanditale AB.

Increasing the use of EWP in new built and renovation can thus play a major role for the transformation of the built environment into a large-scale carbon sink. The necessity to make the impact of this use both as a whole and in detail measurable and to directly make the optimization impact visible, the Forest2Building Digital Twin Framework (F2BDF) has been developed. The F2BDF aims at a holistic view of the entire wood construction supply chain and the whole life cycle, including all steps from forest biological production and supply of raw materials, to processing and engineering of products, their installation and use in buildings, and their recovery during deconstruction. The open framework provides a backbone for interconnecting digital twins and harvesting of data across different steps and scales of the supply chain for analytical and predictive purposes.

Industry 4.0, which started in Germany among the large OEMs, seems to have not resonated much with SMEs. There is an imminent challenge of coming up with a feasible transformation roadmap which will resonate effectively and efficiently with SEMs as they are the core backbone of every performing economy. This research investigates Smart Factories/Industry 4.0 in the Danish SMEs model perspective. This research's main objectives are to develop a feasible roadmap in the form of a conceptual framework for easy industrial transformation to the digitalizing and smart way of (doing things) developing products and/or services. This research employs quantitative research methods such as surveys and interviews where applicable as well as a literature review in the SMEs perspective. Previous research has shown that the digital evolution coined as Industry 4.0 was started among large companies. However, this initial precedence has not resonated very much with all-inclusive industrial evolution, especially within the SMEs perspective. The main industrial implication will be the definition of a clear feasible roadmap for what this research terms as an industrial transformation process - ""digital change management process - Industry 4.0/Smart factory"" in the industrial SMEs perspective - the Danish Model. This research seeks to propose a conceptual smart factory roadmap in an Industry 4.0 perspective, which could be adopted among manufacturing SMEs to effectively, and efficiently transform their production operations.

This study suggests a solution to the problem of tracking batteries along the supply chain and their recycling process. The use of nested tokens allows battery transactions to be tracked and information about raw materials inside them to be retrieved with an easy accounting of those. The joint use of blockchain and distributed data storage solutions like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) guarantees the availability, integrity and non-repudiation of the data and allows interoperation with digital twin models. A smart contract system allows each actor of the business model to carry out only the operations for which he is authorized through the use of rules and certifications issued by a regulator.

It is the largest steel production facility in Australia with throughput of crude steel of over three million tonnes per annum. BlueScope own and operate five berths within Port Kembla. These assets underpin BlueScope as a critical part of the company's supply chain. To maintain the reliability, uptime, and function of the wharves, BlueScope and Beca have sought to solve one of the largest port and wharf challenges: how to turn aging port information, drawings, and schematics into a digital asset that can reduce rework, improve decision-making, and reduce costs. The project area spans more than 1.5km, including thousands of assets. BlueScope and Beca have been working together to create a spatially accurate three-dimensional digital twin of the Port. The Twin is designed to create new efficiencies for future projects and operations for BlueScope as it looks forward to the next century. The Twin can help the organisation unlock greater berth flexibility, reduce tendering costs, minimise risk, minimise shutdowns, and drive productivity enhancements in design, construction, operations, and maintenance activities. This paper outlines the project's motivations and requirements, as well as the strategies employed by the project team to overcome challenges associated with utilizing historical archive drawings and spatial data. By developing a reliable digital twin for BlueScope's port assets in Port Kembla, this paper also shares valuable insights that owners of similar assets can adopt to more quickly reap the benefits. © 2023 Australasian Coasts and Ports 2023 Conference.

Digital technologies offer many opportunities for increasing the precision and sophistication of production systems and supply chains in response to these challenges. However, many current agritech products and services address only single needs and do not explicitly draw on the richness of our knowledge in plant and ecological sciences. These limitations can be addressed through digital twins, which are increasingly being adopted across diverse fields to monitor, analyse, simulate and control complex systems. In this paper we describe the approach The New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research Limited (Plant & Food Research) is adopting to develop a digital twin to leverage the transformative opportunities offered through the purposeful integration of biology and digital technologies. Our goal is to dynamically couple physical components of apple production and supply chain systems with their virtual analogues. The digital twin will direct sensors and external interfaces to obtain input data from the real world, and prescribe optimal interventions based on models that robustly simulate the impact of selected biotic and abiotic stresses on key physiological, ecological and quality modifying processes. We are approaching this task through a series of tightly coordinated research programmes organised around the themes of: building the digital ecosystem; new models of the perennial horticulture ecosystem; and developing and deploying digital twins. We expect that this digital twin can offer new opportunities to increase the profitability, resilience and sustainability of perennial crop systems. © 2023 International Society for Horticultural Science.

Besides the increase in food production, the efficiency of food logistics must be improved to reduce waste. An efficient food supply chain also reduces the final cost of products, increases producers’ incomes, mitigates the environmental impacts, and allows transportation of fresher, healthier foods. Collection and analysis of information on product tracking and stakeholder demands can improve supply chain efficiency, providing important insights to managers. Technological solutions, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Digital Twin (DT), and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), have been proposed for monitoring and tracking products and analyzing data collected while supporting decision-making. However, there are still few studies about the integration of these technologies, especially DTs, intelligent models, and DLTs. Thus, this work presents a review of the application of these technologies for food logistics, identifying the main requirements and summarizing how they can be applied in each logistics stage. Related surveys are discussed to find gaps in the literature and six research questions are defined and answered, aiming to argue about how the chosen technologies can be applied and combined to attempt the identified requirements. Lastly, this work discusses research opportunities in the fresh food supply chain, presenting some open challenges for adoption while integrating these technologies. © 2022","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142682484"

Managing a wide variety of products, as well as the relationships with different suppliers and customers spread worldwide, have become more challenging, especially for companies operating with global and extremely complex supply chains. With its high service level requirements, the spare parts supply chain has been one of the most affected. This paper aims to introduce a digital twin system to support spare parts planning and control through a cost- and reliability-based model design. The proposed model minimizes the overall supply chain cost, including holding cost, power consumption for material handling, stock-out risk, and sale loss probability. This model aids decision-makers in managing spare parts inventory and controlling customers’ service level under uncertainty. The digital twin is applied to a case study of an Italian automatic packaging machine company to support decision-makers on spare parts decisions. © 2023, AIDI - Italian Association of Industrial Operations Professors.

Therefore, it is crucial in the age of Industry 5.0 to create reliable DDoS attack detection systems. In this research, we offer a DDoS attack detection system for the Industry 5.0 environment that makes use of Digital Twins (DTs) and Machine Learning (ML). Our method takes use of the strengths of DTs to model the production flow virtually, which can then be used to track the system's behaviour and spot any hiccups. For further analysis of the DTs' output data in order to spot possible DDoS assaults, we use explicable ML algorithms like the decision tree classifier.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179752800"

Sensing elements assemble data for various aspects of the performance of the substantial object, such as power production, temperature, and more. These data are transmitted to a system where transmitted data get processed and applied virtually. NASA was the first to use digital twin technology for the space vehicle named Apollo 13.

In this work, we propose a new AI-based framework to run the replenishment operations of the factory node for a three-echelon SC with production capacity constraints. We focus on the factory since the delivery lead times from the supplier to the factory are stochastic and can experience sudden delays due to unforeseen disruptive events. The factory node adopts the smoothing order-up-to (S-OUT) replenishment policy and the order quantity must be subject to a minimum order quantity (MOQ) constraint. The proposed framework consists of a digital twin, which periodically interacts with a virtual model of the physical supply chain, and a machine learning engine powered by a metaheuristic algorithm that dynamically adjust the replenishment parameters to maximize the fill rate while reducing the stock level. To this end, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are employed in the dynamic selection of the S-OUT parameters. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experimental campaign was carried out; there, the AI-based framework is compared with the static scenario, in which the same replenishment parameters are adopted over the entire time horizon. The analysis of results demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed machine learning method to promptly face the effects of disruptions and increase the performance of SCs. © 2023 Computers and Industrial Engineering.

The business environment is forcing logistics companies to optimize their delivery processes, integrate new technologies, improve their performance metrics, and move towards Logistics 4.0. Their main goals are to simultaneously reduce costs, environmental impact, delivery times, and route length, as well as to increase customer satisfaction. This pilot experiment demonstrates the integration of new digital technologies for process optimization in real time to manage intraday changes. Postal operators can increase flexibility, introduce new services, improve utilization by up to 50%, and reduce costs and route length by 12.21%. The Cognitive Advisor has shown great potential for the future of logistics by enabling a dynamic approach to managing supply chain disruptions using sophisticated data analytics for process optimization based on the existing delivery infrastructure and improving business processes.

The implementation of methodologies for predicting and managing environmental impacts is vital. One such methodology is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which, related to energy simulations in buildings, characterises a more sustainable construction practice that surpasses the notion of a green building. To attain further enhancement, building material choices based on physical, mechanical and chemical properties should be thoroughly examined. Finally, monitoring building interventions is crucial for planning maintenance and tracking their current status in real-time.This investigation seeks to contextualise the function of construction materials, specifically bio-based plant fibre materials, in scientific research. Additionally, it scrutinises the potential and limitations of incorporating cutting-edge technologies (Blockchain, AI, IoT, BIM, GIS, sensors, mathematical models) in generating a Digital Twin that cohesively collates all this data while adhering to the seven Keys.The proposed Digital Twin model's architectural framework will contribute to Smart Buildings in Smart Cities, where manufacturing companies, research bodies, and governmental institutions are committed to enhancing the quality of citizens' lives.

The solution provides several predefined daily runs in an automated manner, which can be visualized via an interactive web-based dashboard across ADNOC. Further, ICM allows for configuring ad-hoc scenarios to analyze/evaluate special operating cases and develop business plans. ICM's goal is to provide ADNOC's Upstream a way to identify/assess opportunities for accelerated production growth. ICM is a digital twin of ADNOC's assets running in compositional mode, allowing it to accurately compute the moles/mass of any component in the production system. As different wells, producing at different rates, commingle and finally separate into product streams, ICM can determine the CO2 load (or CO2 Intensity) per barrel of oil produced. A mix-and-match of different assets can give different CO2 Intensities. For a desired production target, ICM can provide the optimum mix of production from wells/reservoirs/fields/assets targeting the lowest total CO2 Intensity per barrel of oil in the product stream, while observing capacity/operational constraints of the supply chain. ICM's main technology component is a Digital Twin consisting of components like data model and management, visualization framework, physics-based well and surface network models and work process. This is described in detail later. ICM has demonstrated its value and benefits to ADNOC in production engineering and business planning. It has also demonstrated its capability to help ADNOC maximize its supply chain value through integration with the downstream Integrated Production Planning and Portfolio Management and Optimization systems. Going forward, ADNOC is focused on expanding the value of ICM by addressing sustainability issues within the context of production planning and optimization. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176796217"

They will affect every individual and every enterprise in ways that are predictable and in ways that are unexpected. For an enterprise, their existence and use will affect all stakeholders: changing customers experiences, disrupting established business models, and transforming an enterprise’s operations, sales & marketing, R&D and innovation, strategy, governance, and everything that affects an enterprise’s success. Consider the following: The Digital Twin supply chain is rapidly expanding and evolving. Digital Twins are becoming much easier to create, use and integrate with startups playing a major role. The combination of digital twins and artificial intelligence is creating complex and dynamic twins that ‘understand’ the world in ways that humans alone cannot comprehend. Intelligent digital twins will self-modify and evolve independent of human intervention. The outcomes will be unexpected and significant. These intelligent Digital Twins will disrupt and transform every existing business model and make new ones possible that create new types of value. A digital first future could eventually emerge in which virtual Digital Twin and Metaverse assets are the primary source of value, and the physical/real world is secondary. This chapter discusses how Digital Twins, and the digital twin ecosystem, changes what we know about the creation of value. It discusses the changes that digital twins cause in value propositions, business models, artifacts, experiences and how enterprises and individuals influence each other. It covers how Digital Twins can transform markets and marketplaces, channels and supply chains, offerings, and operations. More importantly, this chapter discusses a future in which the relationship between the digital and physical worlds will fundamentally alter the value that individuals and enterprises create and consume. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170157279"

Today’s manufacturers are dealing with disruption and change in all forms. How do you know how your manufacturing and supply chain will respond? More importantly, how can you leverage technology and “gamification” to predict how the manufacturing and supply chain will behave if “anything happens”? The answer is through the use of Manufacturing Digital Twins. Digital Twins are not limited to the product anymore. Manufacturing and Supply Chain Digital Twins exist in many companies today and represent a wide arrange of scope and depth of detail. Technology advancements have enabled early stage manufacturing digital twins to evolve from being equipment focused to completely represent the factory, manufacturing processes, and even the supply chain. Manufacturing Digital Twins break down data and operational silos, provide holistic views, and enable multiple strategies to test different business scenarios – in a virtual environment and without impacting the physical production and order flow. Manufacturing Digital Twins are all different, based on the industry, manufacturing model, and supporting supply chain. Companies today are reaping the rewards for early and continued investment in Manufacturing Digital Twins; others are just starting the journey. Many lessons can be learned from the history of Manufacturing Digital Twin’s evolution, the impact of technology and computing power, and how company strategy and approach affects success – or failure. “Anything is possible” as Manufacturing Digital Twins and Supply Chain Digital Twins are here. Leaders are using them to differentiate, win and compete in today’s markets.

The research seeks to offer an extensive review of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the supply chain. This includes analyzing how AI may be used for demand forecasting, optimizing transportation, managing warehouses, optimizing procurement, and mitigating risks. The article showcases the concrete advantages of AI-driven solutions through the analysis of real-life scenarios. These benefits include increased precision in demand forecasting, better transportation routes, higher efficiency in warehouses, faster procurement procedures, and efficient techniques for mitigating risks. The study's findings demonstrate that AI possesses the capacity to greatly boost supply chain performance through the improvement of efficiency, reduction of costs, and increase of robustness. Nevertheless, the article also recognizes the difficulties linked to the application of AI, such as substantial upfront investment needs, worries about data privacy and security, the absence of transparency and comprehensibility, possible job displacement, and ethical considerations. In order to tackle these difficulties and enhance the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) in the supply chain, the paper suggests potential avenues for future research. These include making it a priority to create explainable AI (XAI) algorithms, taking steps to lower the risk of job loss, setting moral standards for the proper use of AI, combining AI with new technologies like blockchain, the Internet of Things (IoT), and digital twins, and coming up with AI solutions for complicated supply chain situations. Through tackling these obstacles and investigating novel areas of study, artificial intelligence (AI) can persist in its crucial function of defining the forthcoming trajectory of the supply chain, which will result in the promotion of innovation, effectiveness, and sustainability throughout the worldwide economy. © 2023 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199978436"

In response to these challenges, the agri-food industry has increased its efforts to shift to using more digital tools and other advanced technologies. The transition toward digital has been part of the fourth industrial revolution (called Industry 4.0) innovations that have and are reshaping most industries. This literature review discusses the potential of implementing digital technologies in the agri-food industry, focusing heavily on the role of the COVID-19 pandemic in fostering the adoption of greater digitalization of food supply chains. Examples of the use of these digital innovations for various food applications, and the barriers and challenges will be highlighted. The trend toward digital solutions has gained momentum since the advent of Industry 4.0 and implementations of these solutions have been accelerated by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Important digital technology enablers that have high potential for mitigating the negative effects of both the current global health pandemic and the environmental crisis on food systems include artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet of Things, blockchain, smart sensors, robotics, digital twins, and virtual and augmented reality. However, much remains to be done to fully harness the power of Industry 4.0 technologies and achieve widespread implementation of digitalization in the agriculture and food industries.

This chapter provides an overview of the recent developments in data analytics applications in supply chain resilience (SCR) and supply chain sustainability (SCS). There has been an exponential growth of literature on data analytics applications for SCR and SCS, with a particularly notable increase observed since 2015. In this systematic literature review, we find that both SCR and SCS research are concentrated around five main themes: (1) data analytics capabilities, (2) role of Industry 4.0, (3) blockchain adoption, (4) big data analytics, and (5) machine learning. Closed-loop supply chain design and circular economy are of unique focus in SCS, while digital twin only emerged as a research theme in SCR research. The underlying themes in SCR contexts are more dispersed than in SCS, mostly due to the comparative maturity of SCS research. In light of the promising developments in data analytics applications for SCR and SCS, promising avenues for future inquiry are the design of effective data-sharing incentive mechanisms, and the utilization of big data from social media platforms, yielding valuable insights for both research and practitioners. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163627233"

Among the benefits include real-time product tracking, environmental sustainability, enhanced production, and cost savings. The use of blockchain technology in a three-tiered Supply Chain Network (SCN) shows promise in terms of boosting supply chain transparency and security. The SCOR model is also discussed as a comprehensive framework for optimising supply chain processes. However, concerns such as data privacy, security, and employment displacement must be solved before firms can fully reap the benefits of new technologies. Overall, embracing these innovations has the potential to revolutionise supply chain management and create trust among stakeholders.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187387723"

These lead to a threatening security posture in organizations. Security analytics is a collection of capabilities and technologies systematically processing and analyzing data to detect or predict threats and imminent incidents. As digital twins improve knowledge generation and sharing, they are an ideal foundation for security analytics in the IoT. Digital twins map physical assets to their respective virtual counterparts along the lifecycle. They leverage the connection between the physical and virtual environments and manage semantics, i.e., ontologies, functional relationships, and behavioral models. This paper presents the DT2SA model that aligns security analytics with digital twins to generate shareable cybersecurity knowledge. The model relies on a formal model resulting from previously defined requirements. We validated the DT2SA model with a microservice architecture called Twinsight, which is publicly available, open-source, and based on a real industry project. The results highlight challenges and strategies for leveraging cybersecurity knowledge in IoT using digital twins. © 2023 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148686864"

Our architecture addresses the authenticity and integrity of devices and processes within heterogeneous system landscapes. We identify and discuss the current challenges in digital supply chains and lay out security, privacy, and interoperability requirements that must be met for successful implementation. We hypothesize that the overall perception of trust in a supply chain depends on the trustworthiness of all digital systems involved, including hardware, software, and information flow. Our proposed architecture helps enhance trustworthiness based on verifiable, indisputable, and believable digital evidence for devices and processes in supply chains, including the entire hardware and software lifecycles. We actively advocate for a mixed landscape of centralized and decentralized solutions for the storage of evidence and trust information. This can include traditional centralized databases and distributed ledger technologies. We discuss the auditability and accountability of digital evidence using trust-enabling technologies, and present a preliminary proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation in a real-world application scenario. © 2023 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173536226"

To address the needs of the industry and achieve a higher level of sustainability a robust tool, such as a Digital Twin, must be used because the physical processes are highly complex, with constantly changing variables. On the other hand, current goals of the manufacturing sector, such as circular economy and zero-emissions, require data sharing in the supply chain. This paper presents the development of a framework for the assessment of energy efficiency and sustainability of production processes, with respect to the measured consumption of the different resources. In addition, a concept for privacy preserving data sharing within the manufacturing supply chain is presented. Two real case studies from the big component production industry located in northern Germany are discussed in this paper. As result, the framework is presented and the case study successfully identifies significant energy efficiency and sustainability optimization possibilities, achieved with very simple modeling. © 2023 The Authors.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused manufacturers to rethink and reassess their global supply chains and the flexibility of their production sites. Resilience means the ability to withstand difficult situations without incurring significant extra costs. The deficiencies can be attributed largely to the lack of efficient ways for trusted data sharing among the value chain stakeholders without interoperability barriers. There is a need to be able to determine when such changes lead to deterministic-chaotic behavior with far reaching consequences. This work presents a framework to support production networks' reconfiguration for resilient manufacturing value chains. The proposed concept utilizes platform-based manufacturing that builds on the concept of dataspace and its reference implementations of Gaia-X and IDS for data-sharing in the horizontal supply chain and the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) for implementing intra-factory reconfiguration practices. Moreover, the proposed framework considers the Digital Twin of the value-adding network as a key enabling technology to achieve reconfiguration of production systems and networks. The concept has been projected upon an industrial case in order to validate its potential. © 2023 The Authors.

As an impact, we no longer need to collect data traditionally because our devices can be linked to software that enables us to collect data in real time. A digital twin represents a virtual process or service that is virtual and enables analysis of the system to identify potential issues before they arise. These technology initiatives boost work productivity and directly collect data from the field, intending to make improvements or changes. Wearable sensors are utilized for the farming environment, crops, and livestock monitoring, maintaining quality, and organizing the food supply chain. More applications can be envisaged, such as monitoring farmers’ movement to prevent hazardous farmer risk activity. Wearable sensors on farmers can be used to create a digital twin control system to help farmers understand their farm performance and improve productivity. Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) wearable sensors are used to acquire real-time data on bone rotation from a farmer’s body. Components include a microcontroller, sensor, display, and battery. User Datagram Protocol (UDP) communication library sends data and maps it to 3D characters. Based on the farmer’s position, specially trained neural network plays a “cow-milking” animation. This experiment demonstrated the use of wearable sensors to monitor farmer activity in the field. The sensors successfully connect to a farmer character in the game engine-based simulation, and animation is played when the bone rotation value reaches a certain level of wearable sensors that are effective in simulating digital twin control. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169840320"

An essence of insect-based bioconversion is to feed insects on food wastes and then harvest and refine the developed insects into value-added commodities. This is a circular bioeconomic approach that can efficiently upcycle the nutrients and energy in food waste streams back into agricultural supply chains, but the difficulty is how to realize mass production of insects. This paper reports a commercial-scale insect-based bioconversion system using black soldier flies, whose design and development follow a digital twin paradigm. In particular, an industrialized rearing environment has been established, where the larvae growth can be systematically monitored, controlled, and managed to evaluate the overall bioconversion process efficacy.

Space mission management is perhaps one of the hardest engineering and management challenges humanity has ever faced. Precious Payload's developed software suite to solve the problem and make space logistics a commodity. Our key insight is that the end-user business objectives of a space mission can be decomposed into mission requirements using a common syntax. These requirements are easily translated into task orders for space industry contractors and regulators. We developed this translation layer for seamless movement of data and actions across teams of satellite developers and launch providers. Our first product Launch.ctrl is a gateway to all space mobility solutions available on the market. During the mission design, more than half of the engineering time is spent conducting RFI/RFP (Request For Information/Request For Proposals) cycles and figuring out the best supplier for your mission. Our ultimate goal for the Precious Payload software suite is to allow users to create a digital twin of an asset in orbit, providing a robust environment for testing, troubleshooting, and tasking the sensors onboard.

Within a PI network, logistics operators contribute by providing π-nodes that perform various functions such as receiving, transporting, storing, and redistributing π-containers, which are the unit loads used in PI. The Digital Twin (DT) technique involves the creation of a digital model that replicates the functioning of real-world systems. This paper seeks to demonstrate the potential benefits of implementing a DT of a π-node within an entire PI network. Specifically, it examines the case of a π-store, a unique type of node tasked with receiving goods, temporarily storing them, and subsequently releasing them. In this study, the successful development of an automated storage and retrieval system DT is presented, as well as the various PI interface models aimed at analyzing the types of information that could prove valuable when sent to or received from the network. Finally, the ways in which information received from the PI can improve the effectiveness of the node DT and, in turn, the efficiency of the warehouse system are examined. © 2023, AIDI - Italian Association of Industrial Operations Professors.

We identify how supply chain management systems help in coordinating the planning and operations of emerging business models in pharmaceutical sector though network optimization. Since pharmaceutical products are for human consumption, complete control over distribution chain is mandatory. Hence, we focus on modern supply chain having traceable, secure, globalized and compliant logistics for the pharmaceutical sector. We simulate the pharmaceutical supply chain using digital twins. We utilize discrete event simulation methodology using anylogistix simulation and optimization toolkit. The case study in this work is the Jan Aarogya (peoples’ health) scheme in India, which is built on the modern supply chain paradigm of hub and spoke architecture. We find that digital twins can significantly improve the decision-making during large-scale healthcare disruptions. We simulate pharmaceutical supply chains during disruptions by focusing on system resilience. A system resilience is composed of component resilience, buffer inventory and time. We derive the impact of disruptions and build a simulation model for the located pharmaceutical hubs. Based on our simulation model for pharmaceutical supply chains, we show the impact of network utilization and proactive planning. Suitable recommendations for policy makers is also highlighted based on the analysis results. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165750548"

An emerging technology that has the potential to substantially increase the efficiency of the multifaceted and interconnected port processes is the digital twin. Although digital twins have been successfully integrated in many industries, there is still a lack of cross-domain understanding of what constitutes a digital twin. Furthermore, the implementation of the digital twin in complex systems such as the port is still in its infancy. This paper attempts to fill this research gap by conducting an extensive cross-domain literature review of what constitutes a digital twin, keeping in mind the extent to which the respective findings can be applied to the port. It turns out that the digital twin of the port is most comparable to complex systems such as smart cities and supply chains, both in terms of its functional relevance as well as in terms of its requirements and characteristics. The conducted literature review, considering the different port processes and port characteristics, results in the identification of three core requirements of a digital port twin, which are described in detail. These include situational awareness, comprehensive data analytics capabilities for intelligent decision making, and the provision of an interface to promote multi-stakeholder governance and collaboration. Finally, specific operational scenarios are proposed on how the port's digital twin can contribute to energy savings by improving the use of port resources, facilities and operations.  © 2013 IEEE.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164811315"

The dynamic business environment enhances the uncertainty and the risk of not meeting the business goals. Warehouses might be able to address some levels of uncertainty such as demand fluctuations. Yet, inventory accumulation may lead to becoming a source of inefficiency from the lean methodology perspective. Therefore, the application of the lean methodology and its well-known method, Value Stream Mapping (VSM), has not received much attention in the warehouse efficiency assessment context. On the other hand, Industry 4.0 refers to the ongoing fourth industrial revolution promoting connectivity and information sharing with some key enabling technologies, including the internet of things (IoT), simulation, and digital twin. The digital twin technology is considered a strategic technology and offers a practical way for a system performance assessment. This paper aimed to introduce an approach that integrates the VSM method with the digital twin concept. The proposed structured approach can be used for the performance evaluation of a warehouse while adapting to the dynamic nature of warehousing. The developed digital model can be used for real time warehouse performance monitoring and control when connected with the physical warehouse through communication devices. The proposed approach in this paper is applied to a real case to demonstrate its applicability. © 2023, Publish-Ing in cooperation with TIB - Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology University Library.

As a result of the growing demand for fast delivery of a large number of small batches of goods, the existing management model is ineffective. Analysis of existing approaches to increasing the competitive ability of supply chains has shown that supply chains are becoming increasingly complex and diverse in terms of strategy, structure and behavior. On the basis of an interdisciplinary approach (adaptation strategies and models of applied digitalization), the strategy of proactive planning of productivity and the use of modern means of digital technologies: digital twins and block chains to increase the competitive ability of supply chains in the new conditions of socio-economic sustainable development of industry 4.0 is substantiated.

Crucial factors for sustainable energy supply are reliable and economical energy storage systems. Associated with that is the development of giga factories with a capacity of up to 1000 GWh in 2030 in Europe (currently 25 GWh) for the production of battery cells especially for the automotive sector, which is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in Europe. In addition to the required investments, high scrap rates due to unknown interdependencies within the process chain represent a central challenge within battery cell production. Another key challenge in series production is the product tracking along the value chain, which consists of continuous, batch and discrete processes. Because of its complexity the battery cell production industry is predestined for Industry 4.0 applications in order to meet the current challenges and to make battery cell production more efficient and sustainable. Digital twins and the use of AI algorithms enable the identification of previously unknown cause-effect relationships and thus a product improvement and increased efficiency. In this paper, the digital twin of a battery cell production will be developed. For this purpose, general requirements for the field of battery cell production are first determined and relevant parameters from the literature as well as from a production pilot line are defined. Based on the requirements and the selected parameters a corresponding structure for the digital twin in battery cell production is built and explained in this contribution. This provides the basis for measures to optimize production, such as predictive quality. © 2023, Publish-Ing in cooperation with TIB - Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology University Library.

Postharvest, the quality of strawberries deteriorates and an accurate representation of the marketability of the digital twin becomes crucial. However, a true data driven model is difficult to build due to lack of sufficient data which can be collected during transportation. With the help of trained food and postharvest scientists, marketability data was collected on a large volume of strawberries exposed to different temperature treatments in environmental chambers. Later, machine learning was used to learn the correlation between the marketability of strawberries and the typical temperatures they are exposed to during transportation. We demonstrated that the proposed data-driven algorithm can achieve a similar marketability assessment as the trained experts in the field with an error percentage as low 4.21% using support vector regression which can enable smart distribution such as First-Expired-First-Out.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168657721"

The algorithms and results of the first lab trial are presented for water-based mud. The Fluid Advisory System methodology consists of a data pipeline for loading historical data into a master table, a training pipeline for creating a fluid property model (digital twin) using Machine Learning (ML); an automated predictive analytics tool for model selection; and incorporating the predictive models into a prescriptive model that determines quantity of additives to use to achieve a desired set of drilling fluid properties. Given the initial product composition, a set of desired and current fluid properties, the prescriptive model suggests necessary modifications in additive concentrations. This is achieved by setting and solving an optimization problem. First, the Autonomous Fluid Management algorithms have been validated in small-scale lab experiments. Following these successful experiments, a yard-scale trial was conducted at the Equinor Sandsli Automatic Drilling Fluid Laboratory. The yard trial demonstrated how remote control of drilling fluid treatment equipment and the Fluid Advisory System can be employed. The results of the tests reveal that it is now feasible to remotely regulate drilling fluid mixing and apply the ML-based Fluid Advisory System to maintain desired drilling fluid properties for weight, rheology, API fluid loss, pH, hardness, and chlorides. The Fluid Advisory System was developed to aid in the optimization of the real-time drilling fluids treatment process for usage in an Integrated Operations Level 3 environment (IO level 3) and higher (IO level). This takes a step towards autonomous drilling fluid management that will allow for reduction of personnel needed to monitor and maintain a drilling fluid system; more consistent fluid performance and properties; more efficient rig supply chain; lower NPT; safer operations; lower operational cost; and lower carbon footprint. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a Fluid Advisory System for maintaining multiple properties of a drilling fluid was developed and validated experimentally in a remote-controlled mixing facility.

During the pandemic period, the problem of meeting delivery on time according to customer needs has intensified in many companies around the world. Companies would like to keep inventories at a level that ensures smooth order fulfilment while minimizing their own costs. Determining the optimal parameters is, however, a major challenge for Supply Chain inventory policy(SC).Combining simulation methods with optimisation techniques offers a methodology for obtaining an acceptable solution and, at the same time, provides a high degree of flexibility in the formulation of assumptions and the possibility of improving the decision-making process with respect to risk management. In this paper we present a simulation-based optimisation model to improve the quality of inventory management decisions in SC design and planning.

Those tools not only help create new products for customers but also enable delivering them in increasingly shorter time periods. To achieve both, the ability to transfer, exchange, integrate, and analyze digital data among supply chain participants with diverse software tools is needed. Creating that ability, however, requires a higher level of interoperability with support from semantics tools, such as knowledge graphs and ontologies. As many engineering and business tasks involve digital communication, it is important to develop ontologies for digital artifacts of various fidelity levels and various scopes of the product life cycle to enable the required interoperability. There are ontologies associated with the various stages of the product life cycle. Those ontologies have various fidelity levels that correspond to specific lifecycle stages and that enable the required interoperability within those stages, with very few enabling interoperability between the stages. To address those ontology needs, the Industrial Ontology Foundry (IOF) has released the first version of its Core ontology. The Core provides a basis to represent information about some digital objects such as plan specification as well as physical objects such as occurrence of a process (that may or may not be proceeding according to the plan). While that is the case, there is still a need for the IOF Core to provide further guidance on how they should be related and how to scale to various types of digital and physical objects. To address the issues of relations between physical and digital objects, this paper provides an overview of approaches from recent literature and efforts by the authors and collaborators. It then illustrates in more detail four approaches that are more aligned with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), on which the IOF Core is based. General and use case specific requirements are used to arrive at our initial observations. Finally, we discuss a plan for further analysis.

The final assembly in aviation, automotive, and appliances industries is a rigorous process that has limited capabilities of full traceability associated with: (1) the parts installed, (2) their fabrication processes, and (3) the assembly work. This is also the case for each of its sub-assemblies. The thousands of parts forming a hierarchy of sub-assemblies that are dynamically accumulated to compose the final assembly make full traceability a challenging feat that is almost unsurmountable. Such full traceability along the entire supply chain requires considerable cost and effort since it must be based on documentation of most assembled parts, assembly tasks, and inspection tasks that compose the full assembled product. In addition, security measures are needed to prevent hostile hacking and unauthorized approach to the assembly documentation throughout the entire supply chain. The related documentation and repeated verifications require considerable effort and have many chances for human errors. So, automating these processes has great value. This article expounds a framework that harnesses blockchain and smart-contract technology to offer automated traceable and protected documentation of the assembly process. For this purpose, we expand the concept of a Bill-Of-Assembly (BOA) to incorporate data from the bill of materials (BOM), the associated assembly activities, the associated activities’ specification parameters and materials, and the associated assembly resources (machines and/or operators).

They provide monitoring, remote prognostics and health management capabilities for the various physical assets used in these domains. Many of these capabilities would be beneficial to microservice architectures as well, given the need for lightweight monitoring solutions in multitenant environments. In particular, twins can provide operators with real-time resource usage metrics which help with operational objectives such as resource planning, anomaly detection, rewind and replay and so on. In this work, we propose a design for building digital twins for microservice architectures. As a proof of concept, we focus on modelling the resource utilization as that is a key requirement for monitoring system reliability and security. In general, digital twins require a real world counterpart, a virtual model and a mechanism for consistently keeping both synchronized. We focus on the two latter aspects of the digital twin. Our approach involves converting a formal model of a microservice architecture into a digital twin that can capture and execute an actual cluster's state. We present an extensible architecture connecting the various components of the system and the twin and evaluate the twin's ability to capture the real-time state of a real Kubernetes cluster. We also discuss future extensions which can enhance the system's security by detecting a broad range of attacks.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178270477"

Despite advancements, delays brought by traffic enforcement contact apprehensions disrupt the supply chain's efficiency, thus facilitating implied losses. Although companies cannot control the traffic, the government can optimize traffic flow and enforce traffic laws with minimal disruptions to supply chain delivery agents. A method of optimizing traffic flow while maintaining an uncompromised traffic law enforcement initiative is through an automated no-contact apprehension policy (NCAP). This enforces an AI-based system to detect traffic violations and link them to the license plate information of a motor vehicle. In these systems, an LPR module is essential. This study investigates using a neural network-based LPR architecture for traffic control and management. A MATLAB digital twin simulation is used to model a supply chain flow. The simulation compares and contrasts the supply chain flow in two cases: one where traffic enforcement is conducted in-person, while the other using NCAP. Simulation results suggest that more deliveries can be made when the government enforces an NCAP system. © 2023 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199870094"

Digital Twins (DTs) can realize these features by offering shipping tracking and traceability, process flow and status monitoring, and management of the physical containersall in a remote manner. However, the data of a DT itself is typically stored, controlled, and managed by a centralized entity, which is often the original creator of the physical container. Having a centralized entity can cause mistrust. The centralized entity may alter, tamper, or delete the digital twin data. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes trusted sharing and management of DTs for shipping containers by using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). NFTs are digital tokens that hold unique data stored, controlled, and managed in a decentralized and immutable blockchain ledger. We extend in this paper the use of NFTs to tokenize shipping container DTs and their metadata. The proposed solution uses NFTs and Ethereum blockchain smart contracts to offer decentralization, security, transparency, traceability, and immutability to the data and processes involved in the creation, storage, and management of DTs of shipping containers. To demonstrate our solution, we create a DT of a shipping container using Microsoft Azure Digital Twins services and showed how to tokenize it using NFT. We assess the system using various test cases to evaluate its main functionalities. Furthermore, we analyze the cost of transactions and the security of the smart contracts code. We have made the code of our smart contracts publicly available on GitHub.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164195834"

A crucial prerequisite for managing warehouses is to decide the locations of products (blocks) that can maximize overall space utilization, called a Block Location Problem (BLP). BLP basically determines the product locations to achieve maximum space utilization. One of the most innovative approaches to solving BLP is the use of drones as a block transportation strategy. Existing works have been mainly focused on 2D grid models while 3D flight movement is ignored. Thus, in this paper, we develop a novel data-driven warehouse model for digital supply chain twins. For this purpose, a warehouse digital twin (WDT) architecture is defined by creating a virtual replica of a warehouse that contains the features and interactions of its real-world counterpart. Then, we formalize the BLP in a 3D grid model to decide the location of blocks in a warehouse and to provide efficient space utilization by minimizing the energy consumption of drone cargo equipment. Finally, we propose a genetic algorithm-based solution to solve the storage location assignment. Performance evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves more block utilization and less energy consumption when compared to the greedy solution. © 2023 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190505330"

One of the lessons learned through the semiconductor crisis is that low SC visibility intensifies the severity of the ripple effect caused by chip shortages. Digital SC twins have a high potential to assist resilience analysis in semiconductor SCs because the industry is rich in data and has deployed simulations for a long time. In this study, we examine how chip makers can cope with the ripple effect by the balanced approach combining case study and simulation. The case studies of Intel Corporation and Infineon Technologies reveal that both operational and disruption risks account for chip shortages. Manufacturing flexibility is the key resistance measure that the leading chip makers utilize. Efficient contingency plans, supplier collaboration, and repurposing help them in capacity adaptation. The simulation results underscore the consequences of disruption risks and exemplify an aggravated disruption overlay. We also discuss the potential employment of a digital SC twin to remedy ripple effect and deliver trusted solutions in the high time-pressure context. © 2023, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174443308"

As a result, today's industrial systems integrate information systems and manufacturing systems. In this context, damage caused by cyber-attacks has become apparent, and cyber-attacks on factories are increasing both in Japan and overseas. Therefore, there is an increasing need to implement cyber security measures and education in manufacturing and factories from the BCP (Business Continuity Plan) perspective, which considers safety measures for individual processes and the supply chain. The industrial automation industry is beginning to develop designs through virtual commissioning based on VR product (digital twin) models, and all of this development work is increasingly taking place in virtual space. However, no security educational materials utilize CPS (Cyber-Physical Space), which is free from time and space, based on these technologies. This research aims to develop human resources who can respond to the paradigm shift and realize a suitable environment for cyber security education by constructing a remote training environment using VR product technology that can actually be used in student experiments and practical training. © 2023 The Authors.

Promising reconfigurations need to be identified and assessed regarding anticipatable supply chain performance and costs. Nevertheless, a comprehensive comparison of all potential reconfigurations is difficult as several objectives need to be aligned. To support a rapid preselection of the most promising ones, this paper presents the novel approach of a Supply Chain Resilience Analysis (SCRA), which allows to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of supply chain reconfigurations under disruption to ensure long-term recovery. Key concept of the SCRA is the combination of all relevant metrics into a single Supply Chain Resilience Index (SCRI) that builds upon an adapted process capability index (PCI). The PCI is usually applied in quality management of production processes to assess if a process adheres to specified limits of quality characteristics. In combination with a digital twin of the supply chain, the SCRA methodology can be applied for an automatic pre-selection of supply chain reconfigurations. For verification and validation of the developed methodology and its index, the presented methodology has been applied in a use case of an automotive supply chain. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140458350"

Nowadays, information is accessed in multi- or omni- channel (websites, mail, app, social media). Data analytics and Artificial Intelligence can then highly enhance marketing strategies. Furthermore, there is a high demand of proof of authenticity systems able to certify high-value food credential attributes. Thus, in this paper a blockchain-based system is proposed to manage and certify traceability information and, therefore, the authenticity of food products. In the context of the PININ project, the traceability of dairy supply chains has been considered. A decentralized application (DApp) has been developed for the registration of the collected traceability data in a consortium blockchain, where a limited number of actors can submit transactions and access data. The DApp also allows the publication of recorded data in a regional blockchain to render them publicly available. A mobile application has been developed to connect the physical products with their digital twins. By means of a QR code printed on labels, certified data are then available to food supply chain public and private stakeholders. Electronic collars equipped with GPS and Bluetooth systems have been also developed to geo-referencing cattle in mountain pastures. The acquired data, recorded in the blockchain, allow competent authorities to securely verify the position of the animals for the correct disbursement of European funds to farmers, thus preventing frauds. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168770194"

Also, many sectors of the economy were shaken by the fourth industrial revolution, and the technologies that emerged with this disruption can be used in increasingly versatile scenarios.

Due to the complex nature of global supply chain networks and the increased frequency of disruptive events, there is a pressing need to implement digital tools to support these industries. Digital twins have gained significant interest from industry and research communities due to their ability to provide valuable services in the short term. While there have been many contributions on digital twin-based methodologies for system design and production planning and control, the use of digital twins in supply chain management still needs to be improved. This paper presents an overview of the existing contributions on digital twins for supply chains. Starting from a preliminary literature review on the topic, relevant works are selected and used to identify insights on the current development level and future research opportunities.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185384652"

It is troubling that this great industry faces decades of stagnant productivity and an alarming level of delays and budget overruns in the delivery of projects. Construction faced decades of growing construction-manufacturing gap in business performance. It all comes to one significant difference that explains this condition, the level of supply chain integration along the whole project process. Advanced digital technologies enabled an extraordinary level of business process integration. Construction continues to be the least digitized industry; its digitization level is a little above hunting and agriculture. The dominance of the project-centric approach to business is the main obstacle to construction business transformation.

This study presents a novel approach that combines adaptive machine learning and nonlinear regression to accurately predict the quality of highly customized end products using limited supply-chain data through digital transformation. The research was conducted in collaboration with a major power transformer manufacturer and its supply chain partners. The adaptive model was trained and validated using real datasets from key components provided by the supply chain, resulting in accurate predictions of end-product quality. The model incorporates the core loss parameter, obtained from the power transformer's key component, as an input dataset for training and testing. The proposed approach, called AdaBoost-Regression, combines adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) and Regression machine learning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that the AdaBoost-Regression model outperforms simple AdaBoost and Regression models in predicting transformer quality. The model also exhibits superior performance in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) during real-data verification. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce overall production costs by accurately predicting the quality of complex, expensive, and highly customized industrial products. It can be applied across various industrial sectors.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187243621"

New technologies provide an avenue for improving SCM activities. In particular, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) is one of the technological advances that has received quite some attention in SCM literature. However, especially for smaller countries such as Austria, the actual status of IoT application in SCM is low and research is often limited to analyzing theoretical potentials. The current paper elaborates the status-quo of IoT in eight different industries in Austria by means of expert interviews. Results show, that IoT is only applied in a very limited way. Still, practitioners agree that it offers huge potential, e.g., to increase supply chain transparency, improve planning in SCM or provide real-time information as basis for risk handling. The main benefits of IoT are seen in form of improved process quality, higher level of customer satisfaction due to tracking and tracing, provision of additional real time data, and the creation of digital supply chain twins. Each analyzed company plans to implement IoT in SCM in the future. The paper provides several starting points for practitioners aiming to implement IoT in SCM. Our results also provide several opportunities for future research, e.g., to compare our findings for Austria with findings from other countries with especial focus on SMEs.  © 2023 Owner/Author.","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166301495"

The accelerating digitalization of industries support the migration from Industry 3.0 which focuses on automation to Industry 4.0 where digital twins of both, the product and production itself enable this paradigm shift towards a networked production. Digital twin representations have evolved from definitions of the German Platform “Industry 4.0” since 2017 starting from asset administration shells (AAS) that describe services being offered from assets like products, machines, sensors and software components. Together with OPC-UA as future standard, asset administration shells allow vendor independency and active networking in product design and manufacturing. This enables a new degree of interoperability and thus facilitates the new paradigm of networked production embracing manufacturing across different enterprises. This has the potential to drive outsourcing and just-in-time supply chains to a new level with disruptive implications for conventional product provisioning. Virtual factories could be designed by production elements acquired in a highly dynamic platform-based economy. In addition to this fundamental shift, the technology progress of wireless connectivity results in new interfaces for 5G networks in vertical industries offering deterministic and reliable ad-hoc connectivity of people, machines and factories where needed. The network itself will be treated as an asset in near future being described and managed by an AAS. The digital twin of 5G user ends and network gears will help to forecast potential network loads in given industrial applications and to negotiate the quality of service parameters needed in the actual application, i.e. latency and reliability of a 5G connection. Other recent international initiatives related to trustworthiness focus on the development of trusted architectures in these networked production settings which will further push the evolution of digital twins. Finally, emerging auction-based digital business models enable a new monetarization of services and the negotiation of costs of production under consideration of new aspects such as environmental constraints, CO2 footprints and corresponding additional costs resulting of i.e. energy, waste, and resources supporting sustainability in a circular economy. Thus, digital twins break with traditional paradigms and open up amazing opportunities in the engineering phase of collaborative production schemes. All this will be further supported by artificial intelligence services and powerful Cloud-Edge infrastructures that will help to match the technological, business and ecological requirements and to mitigate between service requester and supplier in a platform economy as a valuable first step in reaching climate neutrality per design. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170199119"

To facilitate perform those businesses, Industry 4.0-compliant service-oriented infrastructures are required. Functionalities and associated data and information can be provided/exposed and/or consumed as services by systems of Cyber-physical things. In the language of Industry 4.0, those physical things are identified as”Assets”. Each physical”Asset” has associated a Cyber-part, the so called Asset Administration Shell (AAS), which contains a set of digitalized Data/Information/Function-Models, i.e., Digital Twins, and responsible for supporting an Industry 4.0-compliant communication/networking of the digitalized Asset. The AAS is fully responsible for the provision, exposition, consumption, composition, orchestration of services. The broad adoption of the AAS in a digitalized industrial environment is mainly depending on the costs of the digitalization-migration-process, which needs to respond to a set of functional and technical requirements. Among others, requirements for using Low-Cost technologies supporting the implementation of AAS with low energy consumption, efficiency and flexibility, should essentially be fulfilled. In this scenario, the authors present a service-collector of AAS that is implemented in commercial low-cost technology and deployed in a common Industry 4.0-compliant network, using REST-API and and OPC UA based infrastructure. The paper describes also the corresponding algorithm to perform the service-collection, based on the Python programming language, which is finally deployed and executed by a Single-Board Computer. © 2023 IET Conference Proceedings.

To tackle the impacts caused by such a pandemic, this study aims to examine the contextual relations among the factors influencing supply chain viability (SCV) for achieving long-term Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Design/methodology/approach: A decision-aid approach by integrating Pareto analysis, grey theory and total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) has been propounded. The proposed approach examines contextual relations among the factors for SCV for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in an emerging economy. This study contributes to theory, methodology and practice by exploring a new research problem in the context of the SCV and COVID-19 pandemic and by developing a new decision-aid approach. Findings: The findings reveal that the creation of SC digital twin and transformation of SCs to supply networks would help the policymakers to deal with the “new normal.” Also, SC crowdfunding and policy development for health protocols are critical driving factors influencing SCV. Originality/value: This research work is perhaps one of few initial attempts to advance the theoretical and practical understanding of SCV and to achieve SDGs in industries following a pandemic risk. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115066610"

Through the process linkage and collaboration of the digital twin, the 4.0 value chain architecture of manufacturing enterprises is dissected. On this basis, the endogenous driving mechanism of the supply chain and industrial chain derived from the 4.0 value chain of manufacturing enterprises is analysed using manufacturing big data, and the framework of the enterprise digital endogenous integration tower 3D process of manufacturing enterprises is proposed, and the nature and derivation mechanism of the supply chain of manufacturing enterprises based on the 4.0 value chain drive is analysed to systematise the formation mechanism and framing mode of the digital twin. The manufacturing enterprise industrial chain is the main body of the digital economy development and the fundamental research paradigm of the new theory of the newly created digital era, whose breakthrough and transformation is the basis for the future matching and optimisation of industrial core elements with industrial digital organisation and technological innovation resources. This is a newly innovative exploration of the digital knowledge system of manufacturing enterprises, which will have a profound impact on the construction of a digital enterprise industry chain with full perception, full connectivity, full scenario and full intelligence, boosting the development of the digital economy and building a new paradigm system of macro and micro interdisciplinary theories.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163288918"

In view of the low level of data sharing and low level of intelligent management and control in the current food supply chain, a digital twin system of food supply chain based on industrial Internet identity resolution technology was built. Taking the rice supply chain as a typical object, firstly, a digital model of the whole rice supply chain covering purchase, transportation, processing, warehousing, packaging and sales was designed, and all elements of the identification coding and data open sharing based on the identification analysis system were studied, and a digital bridge between the physical object and the information system was established. The digital twin architecture, including physical layer, network layer and twin layer was proposed to form the basis for data circulation and sharing based on industrial Internet, and the key model of the twin architecture was defined. The whole element accurate modeling process of equipment, production line, materials and other objects was described in detail, forming a digital twin model integrating geometric model, physical model, behavior model and rule constraint model. Finally, with the help of Unity3D software and C # programming technology, the rice supply chain digital twin prototype system was built to realize the three-dimensional visual monitoring of the production line. The experimental results showed that, on the basis of full sharing of all factor data of the supply chain, the system improved the intelligent supervision capability of the rice supply chain to a certain extent through three-dimensional display, predictive control and intelligent decision-making, and provided reference for the digital transformation of industrial Internet and other technology enabled industries. © 2023 Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

With the rapid development of information technology such as the Internet of Things, the application of digital twin technology in smart manufacturing is becoming more and more widespread. In the manufacturing process, companies still face problems such as slow data flow and a serious waste of idle equipment resources. The purpose of this paper is to carry out a digital twin-based smart manufacturing system that combines the concept of value co-creation to achieve the smart manufacturing goal of using fewer manufacturing resources to create greater system value. The system builds a multi-objective optimization model to enhance the value of the shared supply chain and then helps collaborative manufacturing enterprises to optimize their production capacity and use population intelligence algorithms to solve the problem. The results of the combined case study show that the system is effective in achieving good operation of dynamic equipment resources while improving the overall profit of the system by 13.26%. This study proposes a smart manufacturing system based on the digital twin and considering the value of the supply chain will effectively help collaborative manufacturing enterprises to respond to the market environment quickly, reduce the loss of manufacturing resources while also significantly reducing the operating costs of enterprises, and help to realize the value of the shared supply chain. © 2013 IEEE.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158865190"

Several studies have evaluated the environmental sustainability of reusable plastic containers (RPCs) compared to single-use systems; however, the trade-offs and benefits of reuse are not always clear. To model real-world network complexity with its bottlenecks and unbalanced infrastructural networks, primary data on traveled distances and flows collected throughout the logistics network must be included in the analysis. The material-driven characterization of the secondary package's logistic networks justifies the integration of Geographic Information Systems into LCA to overcome the limitations of using only secondary data, which is commonly done. This study evaluated alternative secondary packaging systems (SPSs) and associated material-driven networks using a spatial Life Cycle Assesment (LCA) approach augmented with a supply chain digital twin. The material-driven network flows were virtualized, and the resulting data on transportation emissions and fuel consumption represent the LCA input. The networks serve a countrywide Food Supply Chain (FSC) from growers to retailers, with up to 1600 nodes located in Italy over a 10-year time span. In this study, the Life Cycle Environmental Impact (LCEI) of nine alternative SPSs differing in size and material-driven network, that is, reusable polypropylene (PP) crates, single-use corrugated cardboard boxes (CCBs), and single-use PP crates, were investigated. The novel contributions of the study lie in the method, scale of analysis, and accuracy of spatial data collection. The results show that the higher transportation emissions of RPCs (+23.80% compared with that of CCBs) are balanced by the reduced production and disposal impacts per use. After 10 years, the environmental impacts of the single-use SPSs are higher than those of the RPC SPSs in all the impact categories evaluated. Considering GWP20, the RPCs are environmentally friendly after only 15 rotations. This study demonstrates the sensitivity of LCA results to transport parameters and highlights the importance of adopting supply chain digital twins to enhance the accuracy of the environmental profile of such complex logistic ecosystems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138387283"

The framework models supply chain processes as queueing networks where agents perform tasks on orders flowing through the process. The modeling approach captures the routing dynamics and stochasticity in both the task durations and order arrivals that are observed in practice. The digital replica creates value by providing a flexible digital environment that can be used to evaluate policies, mitigate bottlenecks, quote more accurate lead times, and forecast and mitigate disturbances. The digital twin model is updated in real-time using the live process data. Optimization models can be deployed in either offline or online mode. In the offline mode, a deterministic optimization model is executed using the most-recent system parameters at expectation. In the online mode, the framework creates a stochastic simulation environment where online optimization can be performed in a feedback loop. © 2022","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138435193"

Mold growth is favored by elevated temperatures in the cold chain or when water vapor condenses in the packaging induced by temperature fluctuations at high relative humidity. Optimal packaging for these products is required to improve homogenous fruit cooling and ventilation inside the package along the entire supply chain. This study analyzed three packaging types (top sealed paperboard, open and closed plastic clamshell) through laboratory storage experiments and simulations. We tested the different packages in a climate chamber, with conditions representing an actual supply chain from farm to retailer. We evaluated the performance of these packages by quality measurements. We measured the fruit mass loss, total soluble solids and acidity content, firmness, color change, and incidence of decay. We also developed physics-based models for the strawberries and packaging to gain complementary information that is difficult to quantify experimentally. These models rely on mechanistic simulations and sensor data to capture fruit's hygrothermal and physiological evolution. To this end, we used monitored sensor data from the lab experiments as input for these physics-based digital fruit twins. We quantified in-silico the time of wetness due to condensation, respiration-driven overall fruit quality, and remaining shelf life along the simulated supply chain. Altogether, our simulation findings revealed that the top sealed paperboard packaging had the best performance in terms of respiration-dependent quality, mass loss and time of wetness. Furthermore, this package showed the least heterogeneities of fruit quality attributes inside the packaging, most likely due to the presence and position of ventilation holes. No clear differences were observed during laboratory experiments in rot incidence and traditional measured quality metrics (i.e., total soluble solids, acidity, color). Combining experiments with mechanistic modeling provides a deeper understanding of how fruit evolves in a supply chain. Also, it can capture packaging evaluating metrics, including moisture loss, time of wetness, or risk for microbial decay in a spatiotemporal manner. © 2022 The Authors","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144386151"

Any excursions outside this range can markedly lower the consumer acceptability of the fruit. However, the loss in fruit quality and marketability largely remains invisible to stakeholders throughout the supply chain. Here we developed a physics-based digital twin of citrus fruit to pinpoint when, why and to what extent fruit quality and marketability are reduced. Sensor data on 47 commercial shipments are thereby translated into actionable metrics for supply chain stakeholders by mapping the variability using principal component analysis. We unveiled a large spread (between 3% and 60%) in the shipments for different metrics of quality and marketability. Half of the shipments currently lie outside the ideal trade-off range between maintaining quality, killing fruit fly larvae and avoiding chilling injury. The digital twin technology opens the possibility to obtain the real-time coupling with sensor data to monitor food quality and marketability. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131325861"

From this perspective, as a use case of IoV, we present a cloud-based EV charging framework to tackle issues of high demand in charging stations during peak hours. A price incentive scheme and another scheme, electricity supply expansion, are presented and compared with the baseline. The results demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical models improve the system performance and the quality of service (QoS) for EV customers. The proposed methods can efficiently assist system operators in managing the system design and grid stability. Further, to shed light on emerging technologies for smart and connected EVs, we elaborate on seven major trends: decentralized energy trading based on blockchain and distributed ledger technology, behavioral science and behavioral economics, artificial and computational intelligence and its applications, digital twins of IoV, software-defined IoVs, and intelligent EV charging with information-centric networking, and parking lot microgrids and EV-based virtual storage. We have also discussed some of the potential research issues in IoV to further study IoV. The integration of communications, modern power system management, EV control management, and computing technologies for IoV are crucial for grid stability and large-scale EV charging networks. © 2022 by the authors.

The spatial disorder and temporal asynchrony of the PL resources due to the uncertainty and dynamicity pose great challenges to efficient resource allocation. The inability to obtain and rational use of PL resource spatial–temporal values causes unnecessary long travelling distances and excessive waiting time, which impede the sustainable performance of PL operations. In response, this research proposes a PL resource allocation approach based on the dynamic spatial–temporal knowledge graph (DSTKG). Internet of Things(IoT) signals data generated from large-scale deployed IoT devices are investigated and analysed to spatial–temporal values through deep neural networks. The DSTKG model is established for representing the digital twin replica with spatial–temporal consistency, followed by reasoning and completion of relationships based on PL task information. The PL resources are allocated efficiently through the graph algorithm from the directed and weighted graph. The case study is conducted to verify the feasibility and practicality of the proposed solution based on large-scale deployment.

This competition has led to the development of new strategies to manage demand and increase market share. Among these strategies are the growing interest in sustainable manufacturing and the need for customizable products that create an increasingly complex manufacturing environment. Sustainable manufacturing and the need for customizable products create an environment of increased competition and constant change. Indeed, companies are trying to establish more flexible and agile manufacturing systems through several systems of reconfiguration. Reconfiguration contributes to an extension of the manufacturing system’s life cycle by modifying its physical, organizational and IT characteristics according to the changing market conditions. Due to the rapid development of new information technology (such as IoT, Big Data analytics, cyber-physical systems, cloud computing and artificial intelligence), digital twins have become intensively used in smart manufacturing.

However, many managers and companies are focused only on new technologies without considering a comprehensive evaluation, and therefore lacking a real need and purpose. As a result, practitioners are often confused with regard of how to integrate improvement strategies and new technologies, as well as how to evaluate their convenience. Thus, this research aims to develop a model for the assessment for each manufacturing capability. This assessment aims to enable a continuous business transformation aligned with organizational goals; thus, a dynamic maturity assessment is chosen. Based on this, the study seeks to provide an integration model for relevant improvement strategies and new technologies that can be applied to any organization. As a result, the paper develops a sequence model, the GUVEI-Model, for the application of Industry 4.0 related technologies for continuous improvement in five different clusters. Furthermore, the research develops an evaluation scheme of optimization alternatives. Based on this conceptual development, a simulation model is built for specific use cases, such as additive manufacturing or virtual reality. The results show how the use cases along the GUVEI-Model application improve relevant indicators significantly, with the first two steps, obtaining and using data, acting as enablers of the three subsequent optimization steps that allow the virtualization, expansion, and improvement of capabilities and a higher impact on the target indicators than the first two steps. Finally, a discussion is presented about the utility of digital twin models for dynamic maturity level assessment and for simulating project improvement impacts before, during, and after their implementation. © 2022 by the authors.

The chiral Bragg diffraction resulting from the helical self-assembly of cholesterics becomes omnidirectional in CSRs. This turns them into selective retroreflectors that are exceptionally easy to distinguish—regardless of background—by simple and low-cost machine vision, while at the same time they can be made largely imperceptible to human vision. This allows them to be distributed in human-populated environments, laid out in the form of QR-code-like markers that help robots and Augmented Reality (AR) devices to operate reliably, and to identify items in their surroundings. At the scale of individual CSRs, unpredictable features within each marker turn them into Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), of great value for secure authentication. Via the machines reading them, CSR markers can thus act as trustworthy yet unobtrusive links between the physical world (buildings, vehicles, packaging,…) and its digital twin computer representation. This opens opportunities to address pressing challenges in logistics and supply chain management, recycling and the circular economy, sustainable construction of the built environment, and many other fields of individual, societal and commercial importance. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140493103"

Despite a traditional low innovation pace in PI, in the recent years a strong push at worldwide level towards the dual objective of improving the efficiency of plants and the quality of products, significantly reducing the consumption of electricity and CO2 emissions has taken momentum. Digital Technologies (namely Smart Embedded Systems, IoT, Data, AI and Edge-to-Cloud Technologies) are enabling drivers for a Twin Digital-Green Transition, as well as foundations for human centric, safe, comfortable and inclusive workplaces. Currently, digital sensors in plants produce a large amount of data, which in most cases constitutes just a potential and not a real value for Process Industry, often locked-in in close proprietary systems and seldomly exploited. Digital technologies, with process modelling-simulation via digital twins, can build a bridge between the physical and the virtual worlds, bringing innovation with great efficiency and drastic reduction of waste. In accordance with the guidelines of Industrie 4.0 this work proposes a modular and scalable Reference Architecture, based on open source software, which can be implemented both in brownfield and greenfield scenarios. The ability to distribute processing between the edge, where the data have been created, and the cloud, where the greatest computational resources are available, facilitates the development of integrated digital solutions with cognitive capabilities. The reference architecture is being validated in the three pilot plants, paving the way to the development of integrated planning solutions, with scheduling and control of the plants, optimizing the efficiency and reliability of the supply chain, and balancing energy efficiency. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

Innovation management is central to organizations for gaining adaptability and dynamic capabilities to ensure their sustainability over time. Right decisions are essential for the implementation of innovations. How-ever, on many occasions, especially in the product development process, decisions are taken based on static analysis, qualitative criteria, questionnaires, and/or quantitative evaluations that are outdated. Moreover, many innovation developments do not consider the existing databases in their information systems of similar innovation projects, especially in the early phases of new innovations when evaluations are mainly driven by area, group, or person. Furthermore, inventions are introduced in different regions, plants, and socio-economic situations, providing different results. In this context, considering that innovations shape our current and future world, including all products and services, as well as how humans, organizations, and machines interact, the significance of the paper is clear. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an innovation management model based on the Viable System Model to cope with any potential future environment based on internal organizational capabilities. For this purpose, the paper designs a Digital Ecosystem for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (DE4.0) based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act methodology applicable to any information system consisting of a digital twin, a simulation model, databases from existing information systems, and quality management techniques. This DE4.0 provides a huge advantage for the applicability and scalability of innovations as it allows one to plan, monitor, assess, and improve. Moreover, based on the conceptual model, a generic project evaluation scheme is developed, providing a platform for innovation project management and control during the whole innovation life cycle. As a result, the research provides a scientific and practical contribution for an integrated management of innovations based on the best information and set of techniques available. Based on this framework, a supply-chain case study is developed. The results show how, depending on the intended goals, the past experiences, the evolution of the innovation, and the innovation scope, indicators can be influenced towards reaching the initial goals and reducing the innovation risks.

The trend has been for larger and more intense production systems to move beyond the urban boundary that have both environmental as well as social consequences. Technological developments in hardware and software are enabling distributed, small scale, efficient, clean production which can be located within urban boundaries. This research has explored how food production in an urban center for local supply can be modeled using a digital twin. The focus is on a vertical, container farm and the supply to local customers using typical manufacturing and supply chain framing. In presenting the modeling capability and results, the paper brings out the challenges of modeling semi-automated production and opportunities for extending the design of the food system to impact on environmental performance.

Despite the potential advantages of Digital Twin, such as virtual accessibility, remote monitoring, and timely customisation, not all sorts of enterprises have the resources or capabilities to incorporate such an advanced system, particularly Small to Medium size Enterprises (SMEs), due to their volatile nature of Supply Chains (SC). In this context, a Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)-based, Agent Oriented Smart Factory (xAOSF) framework presents an over-arching SC architecture, with an associated Agent Oriented Storage and Retrieval (AOSR) based warehouse management strategy to help bridge the gap between Industry 4.0 frameworks and SME-oriented setups. This paper presents an approach towards realising the concept of Digital Twin via the xAOSF/AOSR framework, utilising state-of-the-art semantic modelling and analytical industrial tools. An amalgamation of CPS and Big Data Analytics is important to establish an effective Digital Twin to improve system scalability, security, and efficiency. This paper brings attention to this critical intersection and highlights how the xAOSF/AOSR framework can be scaled to implement Digital Twin effectively, which helps in analysing the bottleneck and threshold-states in real-time, especially in manufacturing organisations, which can lead towards full autonomy in an Industry 4.0 environment. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138256536"

Considering the constraints of multi-distribution center, heterogeneous vehicle performance, distribution cost, quasi-shipment certificate and humanized management, Refined Logistics Supply Chain System (RLSCS) and cross-regional scheduling optimization model of logistics vehicles with multi-distribution center were established. The designed model can minimize the transportation cost, reduce the transportation time, and improve the vehicle load rate. An adaptive elite honey badger target algorithm based on cubic mapping mechanism (IHBA), is designed to solve the model. Further, performance evaluation by optimizing test functions, the convergence performance of IHBA algorithm was demonstrated. Finally, the simulation experiment is carried out according to the actual business data and it is compared to eight other optimistic algorithms.

The use of digital technologies in this approach can enhance resilience and human rights, particularly in the context of the green and digital twin transition post-COVID-19 pandemic. To enrich the sustainability-practice approach, this paper aims to produce a roadmapping taxonomy, based on knowledge mapping of a dataset collected in late December 2022 from the Web of Science Core Collection. As the knowledge map reveals the dimensions of resilience, human rights, and digital technologies, the proposed taxonomy highlights the importance of dynamic capabilities in facing supply chain disruptions, especially their ripple effects, along with the corresponding digital technologies to enhance human social dynamics in facing such disruptions. The proposed taxonomy provides a knowledge-based framework for professionals and researchers to enhance their understanding of supply chain resilience in designing and implementing digital solutions. The proposed roadmapping taxonomy features a people- and community-centric perspective and several managerial insights, contributing to the wider discussions on the green and digital transformation of the supply chain, by shaping actions and interactions in networked, digitized, and datafied forms to enhance supply chain sustainability.

Up to now, test cases are not exchangeable between test processes because interoperability is not given. The developed approach enables the source-to-source compiling of test cases between test script languages. With this, the interoperability of test cases is achieved, and seamless integration within the supply chain is possible. The developed approach uses transcompilers as a baseline. In doing so, an interoperability model for test cases is presented. Based on the interoperability model, a source-to-source compiling for test cases is shown. The outcome is a prototype that handles test script languages, which are different with respect to type safety and applied programming paradigms. The approach ensures that test cases are still understandable and usable for test reports. The evaluation confirms the translation capabilities as well as the readability of the generated test case for the high-lift scenario from aviation. The interoperability of test cases within the supply chain enables the formalisation of procedural test knowledge to be used in a broad range of future scenarios, such as test automation, digital twins and predictive maintenance. © 2022 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140625561"

Digital twin (DT), referring to the virtual representation of a physical object, is well-perceived as a key driver in the development of PI-based Supply Chain Management (SCM). Due to the capabilities of real-time monitoring and evaluation of large-scale complex systems, significant research efforts have been made to exploit values of PI/DT in SCM. Despite this, the current literature remained largely unstructured and scattered due to a lack of systematic literature reviews to synergise research findings, analyse the evolution of research fronts and extract emerging trends in the field. To address this issue, the paper deploys a bibliometric knowledge mapping approach to provide a bird's eye view of the current research status in the PI/DT-SCM area. Using CiteSpace's keyword co-occurrence network, 518 journal articles are clustered into 10 key research streams on PI/DT applications in: job shop scheduling, smart manufacturing design, PI-based SCM, manufacturing virtualisation, information management, sustainability development, data analytics, manufacturing operations management, simulation and optimisation, and assembly process planning. Based on citation burst rate, keywords representing research frontiers of the PI/DT are detected and their temporal evolutions are discussed. Likewise, some identified emerging research trends are production process and system, robotics, computer architecture, and cost. Finally, seven future research directions are suggested, which emphasise on several PI/DT-related issues, including business ecosystem, sustainability development, SC downstream management, cognitive thinking in Industry 5.0, citizen twin in digital society, and SC resilience. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120914637"

More precisely, it is a method of developing sustainable, intelligent manufacturing systems for attaining robust quality, reducing time, and customized products using real-time information throughout the product life cycle. This paper presents a systematic literature review of 98 research papers on various digital supply chain twin dimensions with sustainable performance objectives. The selected papers were reviewed and classified into three broad categories: components of the digital twin, applications in the manufacturing supply chain, and sustainability. Based on the review and future perspectives from the study, we suggest that advancements in technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, and blockchain have increased the potential of digital twin applications in the supply chain. The results indicate that a digital supply chain twin should include the things and humans from the entire supply chain and not be restricted to the local manufacturing systems.

Today's competitive market demands have put pressure on healthcare systems to take a comprehensive assessment of the drug life cycle, its environmental effect, industrial use of energy and resources, supply chain, and impact on end-users. The exploitation of emerging Industry 4.0 technologies will allow a sustainable process design and personalised health care system through the realisation of digital twins, which could transform the pharmaceutical sector to be more flexible, robust, adaptive, and smart. A significant level of research and development has been applied to pharmaceutical manufacturing especially in existing, outdated design and scale-up paradigms in isolated unit operations. However, addressing the key challenges in pharmaceutical manufacturing requires whole systems approaches to incorporate Industry 4.0 concepts.

These include the delivery of a digital platform consisting of an Advanced Process Control system (APC), mechanistic model platform and industrial IoT platform for data analytics and visualisation. The combined solution aligns with the concepts of Industry 4.0 by providing a digital twin, cloud integration, sophisticated statistical, as well as hybrid and mechanistic models. The models are in turn, used for soft-sensors, Model Predictive Control and Optimisation algorithms to predict and control product Quality Attributes.

For this reason, this paper proposes the integration of large-scale optimization problems in a digital platform that allows the solution of these problems for decision-making in real time.

The visualization analysis indicated that management aspects, emergent trends (such as green building, facility management, and automation), and theme clusters (such as interoperability, waste management, laser scanning, stakeholder manage-ment, and energy efficiency) are shaping BIM research towards complexity. Areas such as supply chain, cost, digital twin, and web are also essential. The manual qualitative evaluation classified the complexity issues in BIM diffusion research into three types (complexities of network-based BIM evolution, impact of BIM adoption circumstances, and BIM-based complexity reduction for informed decision making). It was concluded that BIM has been shifting towards information models and systems-based life cycle management, waste control for healthy urban environments, and complex data analysis from a big data perspective, not only in building projects but also in heritage and infrastructure, or at the city scale, for informed decision making and automatic responses. Future research should investigate the co-evolution between collaborative networks and BIM artefacts and work processes, quality improvement of BIM-based complex networks, BIM post-adoption behaviors influenced by complex environmental contexts, and BIM-based complexity reduction approaches. © 2022 by the authors.

Given the impending climate change crisis, resolving this bottleneck is imperative to accelerate the transition to a zero-emission electric mobility future. One potential solution is the use of robotics for fast and cost-effective assembly of batteries at scale. This study proposes a three-stage digital twin design and analysis method to develop robotic workcells for fast and cost-effective assembly of electric vehicle battery modules. Using digital twin design and simulation, robotic assembly line configurations have been developed for battery module production at different scales. Digital twin analytics was used to evaluate and optimise the proposed robotic battery assembly system for speed and cost. Industrial automation experts were consulted to further improve robotic work cell layouts to minimise investment in robots. Because digital twins of robotic workcells have been used, the configurations of the battery assembly line, as designed and validated, are ready for immediate implementation. For practitioners, this study offers heuristic methods to determine the appropriate assembly line configuration, the required number of robots and humans, for a desired production volume. For researchers, this study outlines promising areas for future investigation. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143639174"

We propose a computer-aided system to control and optimize the supply chain to deliver animal feed to livestock farms. Orders can be of multiple types of feed and shipped from multiple depots by using a fleet of heterogeneous vehicles with multiple compartments. Additionally, this case considers some business-specific constraints, such as product compatibility, facility accessibility restrictions, prioritized locations, or biosecurity constraints. A digital twin–based approach is implemented at the farm level by installing sensors to remotely measure the inventories. Our approach combines biased-randomization techniques with a simheuristic framework to make use of data provided by the sensors. The analysis of results is based on these two real pilots and showcases the insights obtained during the IoFEED project. The results of this work show how the internet of things and simulation-based optimization methods combine successfully to optimize the feeding operations of livestock farms.

However, the digital twin system (DTS), which has a single domain, short time cycle, and unfulfillable services, cannot fully reflect the interaction and integration of the physical and informational world required by smart manufacturing. Therefore, research on the smart factory DTS (SFDTS) construction and application with cross-domain, multiple models have important influence on smart manufacturing. Given the above problems, this paper proposes the concept and composition of a digital twin manufacturing ecosystem (DTME) based on the requirements and characteristics of the product life cycle. It analyzes the construction requirements of the DTME for a factory DTS(FDTS), product DTS(PDTS), and supply chain DTS(SCDTS) from the perspective of the life cycle. Finally, the smart factory DTS architecture is applied to the digital and intelligent upgrading of the hydraulic cylinder factory. The experimental results reveal the intelligent improvement of the hydraulic factory, reduction of work-in-progress inventory, and advance of delivery time, proving the feasibility and effectiveness of the SFDTS. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126199836"

In such an environment, determining suitable inventory and cash replenishment policies ensures that cash and inventory are at the right place at the right time and provides a productive SC with high customer service levels. In this study, we first examine the impact of the disruptions in physical and financial flows on SC performance. We then, investigate the potential of a SC digital twin framework to help decision-makers in managing inventory and cash throughout the SC during disruption, currently absent from the literature. The proposed SC digital twin framework integrates machine learning (ML) and simulation to identify the inventory and cash replenishment policies that minimise the impact of the disruptions on SC performance. This approach proves effective in a SC disrupted by demand increase, capacity reduction, and credit purchase increase. Results show that employing the SC digital twin leads to a noticeable reduction in the cash conversion cycle for upstream members of the SCs. We observe that the cash conversion cycle for the upstream SC members is greatly impacted by the inventory policy employed by their immediate downstream members. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, the lack of a cost-efficient logistics planning model often results in the unsatisfactory performance of complex multi-echelon supply chain networks. As transportation planning and scheduling are typically managed via independent entities within the supply network, one key challenge is achieving maximum asset utilization rates considering production flow, logistics cost, and delivery time constraints. This study leverages digital twin capabilities to propose a 4PL-oriented heuristics search model for omnichannel logistics planning and scheduling.

The goal is to develop an approach and a tool that would enhance the capabilities of smallholders to face any disruption by supporting them in all their management and control activities. Thus, the model aims to analyze the effects of risks as well as the policies that can prevent them, act to reduce their impacts, or react against any internal or external risks in three levels: farmeŕs organization, supply chain, and the related environment based on the Corporate Social Sustainability. The purpose is to increase the resilience of smallholders through the improvement and optimization of the agro-food supply chain and related environment of any smallholder organization considering all related stakeholders.

Moreover, human intervention severely affects the environment, and their actions lead to the subsequent deterioration of natural resources. On the other hand, the shortage of natural resources and pollution badly affect fauna and flora. Today's scenario is technology-dominated; automation and digitalization are becoming the twin aspects of promoting green supply chain management (GSCM) system with the help of emerging technologies like blockchain technology (BCT). The application of BCT in GSCM is an integrated approach that manages and coordinates supply chain operations. Thus, it overcomes supply chain challenges and helps to improve the performance of processes and enhances customer satisfaction. The present chapter discusses the green practices in the supply chain using BCT and how the digitalization of GSCM will be established in the organization's ecosystem. Emerging technologies like the Internet of Things and blockchain technologies are seeing greater diffusion in promoting GSCM. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

The combination of agriculture and metaverse will greatly promote the development of agricultural informatization and agricultural intelligence, provide new impetus for the transformation and upgrading of agricultural intelligence. Firstly, to expound feasibility of the application research of metaverse in agriculture, the basic principle and key technologies of agriculture metaverse were briefly described, such as blockchain, non-fungible token, 5G/6G, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, 3D reconstruction, cloud computing, edge computing, augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality, brain computer interface, digital twins and parallel system. Then, the main scenarios of three agricultural applications of metaverse in the fields of virtual farm, agricultural teaching system and agricultural product traceability system were discussed. Among them, virtual farm is one of the most important applications of agricultural metaverse. Agricultural metaverse can help the growth of crops and the raising of livestock and poultry in the field of agricultural production, provide a three-dimensional and visual virtual leisure agricultural experience, provide virtual characters in the field of agricultural product promotion. The agricultural metaverse teaching system can provide virtual agricultural teaching similar to natural scenes, save training time and improve training efficiency by means of fragmentation. Traceability of agricultural products can let consumers know the production information of agricultural products and feel more confident about enterprises and products. Finally, the challenges in the development of agricultural metaverse were summarized in the aspects of difficulties in establishing agricultural metaverse system, weak communication foundation of agricultural metaverse, immature agricultural metaverse hardware equipment and uncertain agricultural meta universe operation, and the future development directions of agricultural metaverse were prospected. In the future, researches on the application of metaverse, agricultural growth mechanism, and low power wireless communication technologies are suggested to be carried out. A rural broadband network covering households can be established. The industrialization application of agricultural meta universe can be promoted. This review can provide theoretical references and technical supports for the development of metaverse in the field of agriculture. © 2022 Authors.

These become heavily intertwined in products, complicating end-of-life treatment. To counteract downcycling and resource depletion, maximising both quantities and qualities of materials recovered during production and recycling processes should be prioritised in the pursuit of sustainable circular economy. To do this well requires metallurgical infrastructure systems that maximise resource efficiency.To illustrate the concept, digital twins of two photovoltaic (PV) module technologies were created using process simulation. The models comprise integrated metallurgical systems that produce, among others, cadmium, tellurium, zinc, copper, and silicon, all of which are required for PV modules. System-wide resource efficiency, environmental impacts, and technoeconomic performance were assessed using exergy analysis, life cycle assessment, and cost models, respectively. High-detail simulation of complete life cycles allows for the system-wide effects of various production, recycling, and residue exchange scenarios to be evaluated to maximise overall sustainability and simplify the distribution of impacts in multiple-output production systems. This paper expands on previous studies and demonstrates the key importance of metallurgy in achieving Circular Economy, not only by means of reactors, but via systems and complete supply chains—not only the criticality of elements, but also the criticality of available metallurgical processing and other infrastructure in the supply chain should be addressed. The important role of energy grid compositions, and the resulting location-based variations in supply chain footprints, in maximising energy output per unit of embodied carbon footprint for complete systems is highlighted. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127325485"

Reducing food waste has been identified as essential to tackle the current climate crisis, and links to several UN’s sustainable development goals. This is especially critical for energy and resource-intensive food products like meat, whose consumption is predicted to reach an historical maximum by 2030. Whilst wastage occurs at all stages of the supply chain, tractable data about the journey of food from production to consumer remains largely hidden or unrecorded. Powered by the latest advances in sensing like smart food packaging and digital technologies such as Big Data and IoT, Digital Twins offer a valuable opportunity to monitor and control meat products and processes across the whole supply chain, enabling food waste to be reduced and by-products reintegrated into the supply chain. This paper proposes a new framework for a Digital Twin that integrates key technological enablers across different areas of the meat supply chain towards with the goal of a “zero-waste”, circular meat supply chain. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141843441"

Then, the paper establishes a system dynamics model to further demonstrate the impact of information digitalization on the performance of the tobacco supply chain in Guangxi, thus providing theoretical support for building digital tobacco logistics in Guangxi. Findings: The findings of the study show that the performance of the tobacco supply chains in various cities of Guangxi is generally at the level of “Pass–Good,” which can barely meet the requirements of tobacco supply chain operation, but there is still plenty of room for improvement. Originality/value: The authors show that digital and IT-based empowerment can maximize the performance of Guangxi's tobacco logistics performance. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113855017"

This is accompanied by increased dependence on virtual product and process development, data-driven processes, and product knowledge. Other characteristics, affecting modern design, include big data intelligence in product, process, and maintenance. New technologies that empower data analytics include added manufacturing, flexible manufacturing, robotics, sensor technology, smart value/supply chains, and industrial information backbones. This paper is about surrogate models, also called digital twins, that provide an important complementary capacity to physical assets. Digital twins capture past, present, and predicted behavior of physical assets. Digital twin models are updated periodically to represent the current state of physical assets. This distinguishes digital twins from conventional simulations in that sensor data can continuously feed them. The type of curated information on the state of physical asset's history depends on how digital twins are used. For example, if a digital twin is used for fault classification, the history captured is operational data from equipment in healthy and faulty states.

Effectively managing operational risk is not achieved by superior quantitative models but by understanding the vulnerabilities and resilience of a system. This paper proposes that supply chain risk mitigation should leverage a qualitative, model-based approach and the well established safety standards and practices applied for complex, safety-critical engineering systems. This approach enables risk to be modelled from the physical component to the supply chain level, mapping the flow of material and parts needed to sustain a company's operation at a production and supply chain level. An oil refinery case study will be used to demonstrate that a qualitative model can be used to automatically generate a set of modelbased analysis outputs that can be used to map and mitigate the cause of failure within an operational environment. Using this method, a model of Australia’s oil supply chain will be developed to address vulnerabilities in the nation’s energy security. This uniform approach, based on engineering principles, demonstrates how a common language of risk analysis can be developed within an organisation and linked to a centralised, traceable risk model. © 2022 ESREL2022 Organizers.

Industry 4.0, through extensive digitalization along the value chain, enables the achievement of these objectives not only in the construction of new facilities but also in existing facilities as well. This requires an interdisciplinary approach, extending over production and logistic processes as well as the building, technical building services, and energy supply systems, consolidated through integrated modeling and simulation-based optimization. The research question this study addresses is how to digitally couple these subsystems and optimize the overall system’s performance in terms of energy and resource efficiency, by distancing from silo-field thinking while using an integrated analysis approach. The article briefly presents a holistic modeling and simulation framework, utilizing modular digital twins (DTs) of all elements that may constitute a given industrial unit. The integration of multiple DTs of these subsystems in a hybrid (continuous and discrete) simulation forms a holistic DT ecosystem of an existing facility. The particular focus of the study is the building representation in this DT ecosystem for energy-efficient production. Based on a methodology including hybrid simulation, building information modeling (BIM), and visual programming, a semi-automated data acquisition workflow was proposed. The hybrid simulation is based on Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism, where the building is incorporated as a building energy model (BEM). Within the abstracted representation of the overall system, the article explores the possibilities of parametrizing the DT of the building, interconnected with the rest of the factory elements, by acquiring information directly from existing BIM models. Through a comparative case study, the proposed workflow is compared to a manual one in terms of integrity and benefits. The study’s contribution lies in: 1) the detection of the required building level of abstraction for a holistic DT ecosystem, 2) the definition of the interconnections between the building-related counterparts and the rest of the virtual environment as well as the data required for their parameterization, and 3) proposing a semi-automated workflow via virtual programming, for BIM-based creation of the building model within a holistic DT ecosystem.

DTs (twinned systems, processes, and products) can be used to optimize flows, improve performance, improve health outcomes, and improve the experiences of patients, doctors, and other stakeholders with minimal risk. Objective: This paper aims to review applications of DT systems, products, and processes as well as analyze the potential of these applications for improving health care management and the challenges associated with this emerging technology. Methods: We performed a rapid review of the literature and reported available studies on DTs and their applications in health care management. We searched 5 databases for studies published between January 2002 and January 2022 and included peer-reviewed studies written in English. We excluded studies reporting DT usage to support health care practice (organ transplant, precision medicine, etc). Studies were analyzed based on their contribution toward DT technology to improve user experience in health care from human factors and systems engineering perspectives, accounting for the type of impact (product, process, or performance/system level). Challenges related to the adoption of DTs were also summarized. Results: The DT-related studies aimed at managing health care systems have been growing over time from 0 studies in 2002 to 17 in 2022, with 7 published in 2021 (N=17 studies). The findings reported on applications categorized by DT type (system: n=8; process: n=5; product: n=4) and their contributions or functions. We identified 4 main functions of DTs in health care management including safety management (n=3), information management (n=2), health management and well-being promotion (n=3), and operational control (n=9). DTs used in health care systems management have the potential to avoid unintended or unexpected harm to people during the provision of health care processes. They also can help identify crisis-related threats to a system and control the impacts. In addition, DTs ensure privacy, security, and real-time information access to all stakeholders. Furthermore, they are beneficial in empowering self-care abilities by enabling health management practices and providing high system efficiency levels by ensuring that health care facilities run smoothly and offer high-quality care to every patient. Conclusions: The use of DTs for health care systems management is an emerging topic. This can be seen in the limited literature supporting this technology. However, DTs are increasingly being used to ensure patient safety and well-being in an organized system. Thus, further studies aiming to address the challenges of health care systems challenges and improve their performance should investigate the potential of DT technology. In addition, such technologies should embed human factors and ergonomics principles to ensure better design and more successful impact on patient and doctor experiences. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

This study compares and quantifies the impact of the different measures in preserving the quality of fresh produce in the cold chain. We employed physics-based digital twins of fresh produce. This digital twin is the virtual representation of fresh produce that can calculate the temperature distribution within the fruit and link these to quality decay based on the measured air temperature data. In this study, 95 shipments were monitored in the cold chain for four fruits (cucumber, eggplant, strawberry, and raspberry) imported from Spain to Switzerland. Using these temperature data as inputs for the digital twins, their hygrothermal response and physiological evolution to evaluate different optimization strategies were simulated. We showed that shortening the time length of shipment by one day at the distribution center resulted in 18% higher fruit quality index for cucumber and eggplant and 60% higher for berries. Lowering the shipment temperature by 5 °C extended the shelf life of strawberry on average by 36% and raspberry by 73%. Lowering the shelf temperature in retail stores by 5 °C prolonged the shelf life of the four fruits, on average, by about 40%, but the reduction is very fruit-dependent. For every 10% increase in relative humidity in the surroundings of unpacked fruit from during transport and at the distribution center by adjusting hygrothermal climate control, mass loss was reduced by 20% for all the studied fruits. Finally, evaporative cooling at the retail stores, which could be done by dry misting, extended the shelf life by more than 60%, due to the induced temperature reduction. Taking advantage of this digital twin's capability to evaluate the different scenarios, we can quantify the impact of cold chain optimizations more efficiently and cost-effectively in the design phase. © 2022 The Authors","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127330738"

Subsequently, we turn to the technological level and present the digital supply chain twin as a contemporary instrument for stress testing supply chain resilience. We provide some implementation guidelines and emphasize that although resilience assessment of individual supply chains is important and critical for firms, viability analysis of intertwined supply networks and ecosystems represents a novel and impactful research perspective.

The use of RFID is particularly suited to IIoT as it does not require a line of sight for communication and can be retroactively affixed to non-smart items. However, RFID communication is affected by the properties of the material the tag is affixed to, specifically the material permittivity. Metal is commonly present in smart factory environments and supply chains and impedes RFID communication. A suitable tag design is required to accommodate these challenges and ensure resilience for Industry 5.0 applications. The research presented in this paper has assessed the communication performance of RFID antenna designs with and without metal present beneath the tag. The RFID tag designs that performed reliably in the simulation were manufactured, and their read range was tested on materials of varying relative permittivity and thickness to represent MP and NMP scenarios. The results have verified the robustness of “Cyber” to “Physical” designs and provide recommendations to support practitioner IIoT tag selection. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132976416"

Scholars have attempted to keep pace with this development initiating a fast-evolving research agenda. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the emerging research stream identifying trends and capture the value potential of digital twins to the field of operations and supply chain management. Design/methodology/approach: In this work we employ a bibliometric literature review supported by bibliographic coupling and keyword co-occurrence network analysis to examine current trends in the research field regarding the value-added potential of digital twin in operations and supply chain management. Findings: The main findings of this work are the identification of four value clusters and one enabler cluster. Value clusters are comprised of articles that describe how the application of digital twin can enhance supply chain activities at the level of business processes as well as the level of supply chain capabilities. Value clusters of production flow management and product development operate at the business processes level and are maturing communities. The supply chain resilience and risk management value cluster operates at the capability level, it is just emerging, and is positioned at the periphery of the main network.

Still, LSCM executives are hesitant regarding DSCT implementation. One reason is the difficulty of making a reasonable cost–benefit comparison, because the benefits of using a DSCT are rarely quantified. Moreover, there seems to be no method of quantifying these benefits as of today. Methods: This article builds upon an extensive simulation study of a constructed organic food supply chain (FSC), containing as many as 40 simulation experiments. In this simulation study, three volatility scenarios in the FSC were simulated and their effects on LSCM performance were measured. Subsequently, dynamic simulation experiments were run to emulate DSCT use. The benefits of using a DSCT were then quantified using a newly developed approach. Results: A conclusive method for quantifying the benefits of using a DSCT is presented and validated. Moreover, the performance evaluation of using a DSCT for the multi-echelon inventory management of an organic FSC is given. Conclusions: The study leads towards a method for quantifying the use of DSCTs that is of importance for research and practice alike. For managers, it additionally provides an exemplary application of said method in the context of organic FSCs. © 2022 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136401242"

This implies that all manufacturing companies related to the industry are faced with the need to implement strategies to manage and control emissions during their supply chain. Under this scenario arises the proposal of a conceptual framework integrated in a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) environment based on the digital control of manufacturing, oriented to the fulfillment of carbon emission reduction objectives. The theoretical proposal is based on the use of an industrial Digital Twin (DT), combining the use of a digital model, a physical model, a CO2 model, and a life cycle analysis (LCA) module. Those models work in an integrated way to estimate and control the carbon footprint with the goal of being able to reduce it. This study seeks to discern which are the appropriate measurement parameters in the CO2 model.

Assessing the vulnerability of supply chains becomes essential, as well as developing operational and continuity plans to mitigate the consequences of disruptions and ensure the continuation of critical processes. Resilience is a strategy to reduce the vulnerability of supply chains, as it provides the ability to avoid disruption or quickly recover from it. Therefore, this research aims to propose a model that contributes to improving resilience in supply chains by integrating Industry 4.0 technologies such as Digital Twin, Internet of Things, and Blockchain that provide end-to-end supply chain visibility.

The integration provides a new disruptive approach for vertical integration and optimization of the greenhouse production processes to improve energy efficiency, production throughput, and productivity without compromising product quality or sustainability. Applying the Industry 4.0 Digital Twin concept to the Danish horticulture greenhouse industry provides digital models for simulating and evaluating the physical greenhouse facility’s performance. A Digital Twin combines modeling, AI, and Big Data analytics with IoT and traditional sensor data from the production and cloud-based enterprise data to predict how the physical twin will perform under varying operational conditions. The Digital Twins support the co-optimization of the production schedule, energy consumption, and labor cost by considering influential factors, including production deadlines, quality grading, heating, artificial lighting, energy prices (gas and electricity), and weather forecasts. The ecosystem of digital twins extends the state-of-the-art by adopting a scalable distributed approach of “system of systems” that interconnects Digital Twins in a production facility. A collection of specialized Digital Twins are linked together to describe and simulate all aspects of the production chain, such as overall production capacity, energy consumption, delivery dates, and supply processes. The contribution of this project is to develop an ecosystem of digital twins that collectively capture the behavior of an industrial greenhouse facility. The ecosystem will enable the industrial greenhouse facilities to become increasingly active participants in the electricity grid. © 2021, The Author(s).","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115602271"

Therefore, cold chain stakeholders often measure temperature along the supply chain of fresh produce. However, the temperature is typically monitored only in one segment of the entire cold chain, namely from the supplier until the distribution center. Besides, such measured data are rarely used for decision-making because they are not translated into the impact on the quality of the products. We provide a solution by extending the monitoring until the retail stores and upcycling these thermal data into actionable metrics. To do so, we use physics-based digital twins, namely virtual representations of the food products. This study focuses on 331 cold chain shipments of cucumber, eggplant, strawberry, and raspberry imported from Spain to Switzerland. We followed these fruits through pre-cooling, thermally stable conditions at the distribution center, and the temperature ramp-up phase before arriving at the retail store. The temperature performance of each carrier and flow analysis of the shipment enabled us to map the complex logistic system better. The digital twins detected that the fruits lost 43 - 85% of their quality before being displayed at the retail store. This quality loss remains invisible to the retailer. Additionally, we found a strong correlation between fruit quality and shipment duration (i.e., for cucumber r = -0.95 (P < 0.001)), which emphasizes the importance of shortening the shipment to prolong the freshness of the fruit. The digital twins have shown a large potential to help further maximize shelf life and uniform product quality. © 2021","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115324713"

Given the currently fragile state of global supply chains, expanding fabrication capacity within the EU is high on the political agenda. At the same time, ensuring fair competition is of paramount importance. While tech sovereignty must be matched by sufficient State funding, it still needs to be awarded in compliance with EU State aid rules. These rules must not work as an impediment to tech sovereignty.

The Covid-19 pandemic has indeed emphasized all the fragility of manufacturing systems and supply chains both globally and locally. The disruptive effects of the outbreak on production systems, warehouses and distribution networks are evidence of the urgent need for digital twins, which are able to reproduce supply chains behavior and guarantee adequate levels of performance. In this paper, a Simulation-Based Decision-Making Framework, which exploits the Digital Supply Chain Twin paradigm to enhance resilience and sustainability in the face of COVID-like crises, is proposed. Preliminary computational tests, carried out on a real agri-food supply chain, show that the framework is extremely promising for evaluating the validity of multiple response strategies, based on resilience and sustainability indicators. The research represents a first significant step in the design and development of a ready-to-use decision support tool, based on simulation principles and the novel concept of Digital Supply Chain Twin. © 2022 The Authors.

Decisions are based on information collected on the job site and in the project supply chain. However, difficulties accessing real-time information, the numerous production planners involved, and limitations on the planners' degree of freedom of action can hinder decision-making. Digital Twin Construction (DTC) has emerged as a paradigm for systems that increase the situational awareness of the construction project among production planners and reduce uncertainty in the decision-making process. Under the DTC frame, this research seeks to determine the scope of action of production planners. To accomplish the research goal, semi-structured interviews and a literature review were carried out to identify production planners' degree of freedom in decision-making when faced with the need for product or process changes. First, the research identifies the operational decisions that production planners make during a construction project in response to developments (as-built, as-performed information). Second, it presents a detailed analysis of production planners' main limitations during decision-making. Finally, the freedom of action of production planners was defined according to their roles. The findings are summarized in a matrix that associates operational decisions, degree of freedom, and professional roles in the context of DTC. The study results showed that production planners' scope of action is limited by the lack of real-time information concerning the construction project status and technical and legal limitations that affect their decision-making process. © 2022 International Conference on Construction in the 21st Century.

Industrial organizations, including those operating in the aerospace sector, are interested in exploiting sensed data in a virtual environment. The Digital Twin (DT) emerges as the virtual counterpart of a real-world system for analysing, monitoring and simulating its behaviour and supporting decisions process. While the concepts of both IoT and DT are widely discussed by the academia, empirical demonstrations on their synergic integration seem to lack in the literature. Considering the HexaSFDT framework, this paper aims to narrow this gap and to discuss a practical case study of an aerospace company. Moreover, it focuses on contextualizing the framework in a process-oriented DT. Following a collaborative approach, several interviews have been conducted with both operational and strategic profiles of the aerospace company. Data flows sensed from the industrial scenario have been analysed to monitor the behaviour of the critical materials management process. Accordingly, the HexaSFDT framework has been customized for fitting the process of the case study. The paper provides a double implication. It discusses the adoption of IoT and DT technologies by presenting an empirical research. Also, through an industrial case study, it supports practitioners, and in particular aerospace companies, in understanding how these technologies can be leveraged to assist people in decision-making. © 2022 University of Split, FESB.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138216770"

This gives rise to numerous challenges related to information and data pertaining to medical devices used within healthcare supply chain, including data integrity, provenance, traceability, and transparency. Counterfeit medical devices are a major obstacle that the healthcare industry is trying to resolve as it poses a huge risk to the safety of its users. Therefore, it is paramount to have an end-to-end system in place that tracks medical devices not only as they move across the supply chain but also as they are purchased and sold online in digital marketplaces. Unfortunately, existing systems follow a centralized architecture, which leads to being a single point of failure and eradicating transparency and authentication. In this paper, we propose a non-fungible token (NFT) based solution that exploits blockchain smart contracts, integrates tokenization protocols, and utilizes a decentralized storage system for a reliable and efficient medical devices traceability system and ownership management solution. In our proposed system, NFTs are used to represent the digital twin of the medical device. This digital twin captures the medical device attributes and its relevant metadata during its life cycle from production, manufacturing, distribution and movement, to current use and ownership. We present the system architecture and implementation details, along with tested algorithms that define the various functions of our smart contracts. The paper also presents testing details and analyses the solution's feasibility through a cost and security analysis.  © 2013 IEEE.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144041470"

Meanwhile, it is also counterproductive to the visibility of the supply chain besides that adversely responsible for optimal inventory policies (OIP). Henceforth, this paper considers the supply chain digital twin (SCDT) for OIP within an integrated physical and digital world fusion vision. Consequently, the agent-based simulation method is applied to create administrative asset shells for small and medium-scale factories. The proposed model incorporates an OIP trade-off for retailers, wholesalers, customers, and factories. The results underlined the benefits and characterized OIP tactics that help estimate system performance. Finally, the managerial implications provide insides for predictive and reactive decisions to ensure the optimal supply chain running cost and customer satisfaction by utilizing the advantages of SCDT. Furthermore, this paper discusses the OIP optimization method and essential measures for developing the SCDT distribution strategy within the trade network. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

This way, while reducing the need to produce new raw materials (e.g. cotton), the problem of textile waste produced is also reduced, thus contributing to a more sustainable industry.

This revolution has caused increased automation and customized production, which has occurred through a synergy between customer demands, stocks, and supply chains. This synergy has also exposed factories to potential cyber-attack threats. Although there is extensive literature available on the topic of cyber security, however, business owners still assume cyber security as business preservation. This study sheds light on a step-by-step cyber security aspect of manufacturing factories with Industry 4.0. The study presented possible vulnerabilities and threats to the networks and devices used in a factory by dividing them into various common parameters. We reviewed the proposed literature and provided solutions to Industry 4.0 factories regarding cybersecurity challenges. The reviewed articles are divided into four segments, starting from the purpose of the proposal, the adopted methodology, the proposed cyber security solution, and finally the author’s evaluation. The study reports on a state-of-the-art cyber security solution for Industry 4.0 factories. The characterization of cybersecurity is also proposed concerning management aspects, by showing that every level of organization has its role. The study also highlighted that cybersecurity could play a crucial role in the creation of value for businesses. It is suggested that despite adding an expert system paradigm for cyber security solutions, factories should also adopt new innovative ways, such as machine learning, digital twins, and honeypots. This review highlights that cyber security is not only a technical concern, but it also needs support from multiple actors of the organization to add it to the comprehensive strategy of an Industry 4.0 factory, and every user must be trained and aware of the cybersecurity risks. © 2022 Curran Associates Inc..

Therefore, scholars and practitioners seek to make sense of how this phenomenon can be addressed concerning companies’ maturity level of supply chain smartness and sustainability. This paper proposes a novel hybrid methodology combining the Best-Worst Method (BWM) and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) to assess the level of maturity for supply chain smartness and sustainability by weighting the functions of supply chain management. A twin-QFD technique is used to obtain a conceptual design to determine the relationship between the functions of supply chain smartness tools and sustainability indicators to assess the level of maturity, whereas the BWM is used to determine the weights of the functions of supply chain management. A case study in the automotive manufacturing industry is applied to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. The findings disclose the prominent smart technologies (simulation, big data analytics, cloud computing) and sustainability indicators (costs, lead time, and damage and loss) in integrating Industry 4.0 technologies and sustainable supply chain practices. Findings also suggest a guideline to compare the current and targeted levels of smartness and sustainability maturity. This study provides insights for scholars and practitioners and contributes to the body of knowledge by evaluating companies’ maturity of digital transformation and sustainable practices in the supply chain functions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115421753"

Taiwan's IC manufacturing sector, the epidemic has not slowed down. In order to avoid chain disconnection and market share, downstream manufacturers have successively increased inventories and even urgent orders, making Taiwan's foundry industry still perform well in the second half of 2021. This research first conceives the control system requirements, and uses PLC to build the system, then uses MATLAB to build the corresponding simulation model, and uses the configuration software to design the important safety human-machine interface to complete the communication function between the human-machine interfaces based on two models. Two models are studied for testing. Under the same input conditions, the physical model and the simulation model can achieve the same input and output conditions, and the possibility of using the simulation model for the electrical control safety design of ISD of new recruits in high-tech factories is verified.

In this paper, we introduce REALISTIC, a novel event-based modeling framework for supply chain networks (SCNs) that includes production processes. It extends McCarty’s Resources-Events-Agents (REA) accounting model with secure transformations, which, across the entire SCN, guarantee that certified output resources cannot be digitally produced ex nihilo, but require certified input resources of at least the same amount as what is produced. This generalizes the no-double-spend guarantee of current BC/DLT to (digital twins of) physical resources and their production. Authenticated human or robotic Internet of Things (IoT) actors digitally sign and cryptographically commit to the veracity of real-world events on an immutable database, without having to take responsibility for their aggregate consequences. User-specifiable interpretations, corresponding to queries and analytical functions in database systems, provide auditable aggregate information computed from recorded events across the entire SCN. This includes fine-grained and trustworthy tracing of final products through multiple stages of production processes, semi-finished products, quality certifications and transportation all the way back to their raw materials. We present a case study for an end-to-end coffee supply chain that tracks fine-grained and detailed information from a farmer’s coffee cherries to retail coffee bags, involving all its actors. Our model handles product provenance; auditable sustainability, quality and trade information; production processes from parchment via green to roasted coffee; product quality tests; farmer certifications; and transportation across the entire coffee supply chain. It is based on field work involving farmers, cooperatives, processors, traders, importers, and a major roasting company stretching from Colombia to Scandinavia. Its REALISTIC-based modeling is the foundation for the design of our prototype implementation, which includes Ethereum blockchain code, RDBMS-based server code and a web app client.

Desk research was performed to review emerging cases of companies that engage actively in using 3-dimensional virtual and digital (3DVD) technologies, such as 3D modeling, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), 2- and 3-dimensional (2D/3D) scanning, and digital twinning (DT). The analysis shows how the adoption of digital technologies provides opportunities to dematerialize the traditional fashion supply-chain model of garment production and distribution and maps the innovative shifts occurring in the fashion industry’s processes, products, and services. The adoption of 3DVD technologies by fashion companies unleashes new opportunities with respect to innovation in products/services and optimization of operational processes to streamline activities, shorten the lead time for designing, prototyping, manufacturing, marketing and retailing, and reorganizing the working phases. These capabilities also drive multicentred business-model innovations and thus affect value creation and delivery and capture changes. In addition, the analysis shows that digital transformation affects the four dimensions of sustainability that are interconnected intrinsically across supply-chain processes. Cultural sustainability is paramount, as fashion is a complex cultural system that is able to create products/services that influence the environment, economy, and society. In particular, 3DVD technologies promote cultural transformation of design processes to achieve a remix of skills and open knowledge, a behavioral shift from the consumer perspective in terms of diversity and self-expression, and a change in the organizational culture of companies that drive the digital transformation. © 2022 The Author(s).

The digitalization of business systems and the use of Information and Communication Technology have had a major impact across the spectrum of logistics and supply chain management activities. A wide range of developments have already taken place and the pace of change is quickening. We chart the principal stages in the development of computer-based and digital logistics systems that have changed fundamentally how goods, information, and finance flow through the supply chain. Contemporary developments covered include cloud-based systems, digital platforms, Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, Digital Twins, the physical Internet, and Industry 4.0. These technologies not only have the potential to support logistics operations but may also act as disruptors to established approaches, practices, and logistics systems. This chapter discusses how these technological developments, in parallel with economic drivers such as cost saving, the desire for speed and accuracy in delivery, and the imperative for sustainable logistics systems, are contributing to the rapid changes and adaptations taking place. Although there are significant hurdles to widespread adoption, digitally enabled logistics is likely to continue to improve supply chain transparency, operational efficiency, and responsiveness. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Digital twin is one of the enabling technologies that link actual physical system with its virtual depiction using advanced digital technologies. In order to leverage its potential, firms have instigated to adopt digital twin and physical internet for real-world applications. Although researches on impact of information technology in supply chains exists, a study on the modelling aspects by analysing critical success factors for adoption of digital twin and physical internet is limited. We have addressed this gap by developing a structural model for identifying the inter-relationships and cause effect parameters of critical success factors for adoption of digital twin and physical internet. Thirteen critical success factors were shortlisted based on literature review and in consultation with experts. An integrated Grey- based, decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)is used to visualize the causal relationships among critical success factors and verified by applying the proposed model in an electronics manufacturing firm. Sensitivity analysis has been done to check accuracy of results and robustness of the study. The results reveal that top management commitment and support and long, medium and short term planning are the most influential factors impacting the adoption of digital twin and physical internet in electronics industry. Findings of this research provide insights for supply chain managers and academicians by identifying the cause and effect group critical success factors for effective adoption of digital twin and physical internet. © 2021 The Author(s)","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120932554"

Industry 4.0 technologies, as recognised enablers for circular systems, can support such collaboration. This study explores the intersection of the circular economy, supply chain collaboration, and Industry 4.0. First, we derive an analytical framework that contextualises circular supply chain collaboration. Second, based on this framework, we conduct a systematic literature review that explores how Industry 4.0 technologies can enable collaboration mechanisms. The review shows that information sharing and joint planning and decision-making are the most common collaboration mechanisms studied. Simultaneously, the Internet of Things, Blockchain, and Cloud Systems are the most discussed technologies to enable those mechanisms. The most prominent review sample patterns are synthesised into three archetypes for Industry 4.0-enabled circular supply chain collaboration. Furthermore, the study derives nine promising questions for future research along six main dimensions: Digital Twins and Artificial Intelligence, joint knowledge creation and innovation, collaboration in product design and planning, systemic collaboration across industry boundaries, contextualisation with barriers for implementing circular supply chains, and transferability of applications across industries. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119342812"

A digital twin is a virtual representation that replicates a physical object or process over a period of time. These tools directly assist in reducing the manufacturing and supply chain lead time to produce a lean, flexible, and smart production and supply chain setting. Recently, reinforced machine learning has been introduced in production and logistics systems to build prescriptive decision support platforms to create a combination of lean, smart, and agile production setup. Therefore, there is a need to cumulatively arrange and systematize the past research done in this area to get a better understanding of the current trend and future research directions from the perspective of Industry 4.0. Methods: Strict keyword selection, search strategy, and exclusion criteria were applied in the Scopus database (2010 to 2021) to systematize the literature. Results: The findings are snowballed as a systematic review and later the final data set has been conducted to understand the intensity and relevance of research work done in different subsections related to the context of the research agenda proposed.

However, contributions addressing the sectoral level of analysis are still nascent in the digital twin literature. This paper has a dual research objective of (1) identifying the digital twin potential at a sectoral level of analysis and (2) investigating whether the existent Enterprise Architectures (EA) approaches and languages meet the requirements for the creation of digital twin architectures. A design science research project was conducted in a leading business association representing the Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Sector (RACS). Our findings reveal that RACS digital twins will need to address the grand challenges of climate change and sustainability. Moreover, the digital twin-driven transformation of RACS will be more effective in cooperation between different supply chain segments, increasing the importance of business associations’ role in the definition of reference architectures for their sector. Our results also extend recent research suggesting the use of ArchiMate language for digital twin developments. This contribution is relevant to sectoral digital transformations supported by digital twin technology, providing the foundations for future sectoral enterprise architecture frameworks. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128934605"

Traceability and trackability of data ensure the compliance of airworthiness requirements. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has strongly emphasised the significance of quality traceability data throughout the aircraft part's life cycle, leading to enhanced inventory control accuracy, reduced maintenance error, and effective decision-making processes. However, with the rapid increase of spare parts types, the complexity of aircraft parts multi-stage supply chains leads to inefficient tracing and tracking operations with unsatisfactory traceability data quality and information security. This paper proposed a blockchain-based system that provided a managerial platform for accurate recording of spare parts traceability data with organisational consensus and validation using Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer. A data model has been determined based on the existing ASPM, enabling information integrity during transaction operations. The channel mechanism has yielded a trustful data sharing platform between each contracting organisation for logistics and operational arrangements, which has enhanced information visibility and security. The blockchain-based system, executed under a decentralised ledger mechanism, shall improve the quality of traceability data and reliable information sharing within the spare parts supply chain. The enhanced blockchain-based inventory management system can establish the digital twin of aviation as part of Industry 4.0 in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105361519"

A digital twin is a virtual replica of a cyber-physical system that is used to capture the state of the system and to allow reason and decision-making on that state. While there has been much research on this topic, there is less work on the overall lifecycle ecosystem that supports the smooth interoperation of a physical facility (like a machine, a factory or even a supply chain) and its digital components (like data, processes and digital twins), which is called the Digital Thread. The aim of the Digital Thread is the creation of a digital lifecycle ecosystem that links together the data generated throughout a product’s lifecycle and represents the data, processes and communication platform that supports a product and its production at any instance of time. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142686712"

A digital twin is a promising tool to minimize fruit waste by monitoring and predicting the status of fresh produce throughout its life. In post-harvest engineering, the digital twin could be defined as a virtual representation of real produce. The objective of this work is to present a new approach to create a machine learning-based digital twin of banana fruit to monitor its quality changes throughout storage. The thermal camera has been used as a data acquisition tool due to its capability to detect the surface and physiological changes of fruits throughout the storage. In this study, after constructing the dataset of thermal data belonging to four classes, the training of the model has been performed using intelligent technologies from SAP. The solution has applied a deep convolutional neural network to monitor the fruit status based on the thermal information, and the training process has shown higher accuracy. Thus, 99% of prediction accuracy has been achieved which is proved to be a promising technique for the development of fruit digital twins. The application of thermal imaging techniques can be used as a data source to create a machine learning-based digital twin of fruit that can minimize waste in the food supply chain. © 2022 The Authors.

In light of the public crisis caused by COVID-19, the authors suggest a signal game model for a two-stage supply chain with two suppliers and two manufacturers. Based on the model, the impact of the digital twin platform on the profits of the local industrial symbiosis network is analyzed. The results show that the uncertainty of supply and demand caused by the public crisis has led to fluctuations in profits and profit volatility. Under this influence, suppliers are willing to participate in information sharing on the digital twin platform, but manufacturers are less willing to participate. Moreover, application of the digital twin platform in information sharing is conducive to maintaining and promoting the smooth operation of the industrial chain under these conditions of uncertainty.

However, because of a huge number of participants in the development process, managing data flows in DTs becomes a challenge, especially when we concentrate on evaluating the product or entity quality from supply chain partners - in other words, the customer in a supply chain may have a different view of quality assurance (QA) than the supplier has, due to a typical large interpretation scope of quality in contracts and agreements, especially for Cyber Physical Systems. To overcome the problem, blockchains can be applied to build a secured environment for the QA information exchange. With the concept of smart contracts, suppliers and customers can align the required information about quality assurance to transparently work towards a bilateral quality agreement. While the general information like a number of passing tests can be shared, the details of tests are only shared among private agreements. In this paper, we present a blockchain based QA process management for DTs to increase the reliability of the network and maintain the private information of participants. Our experiments showed that our blockchain application has the capability to be deployed in multiple partners while guaranteeing network reliability and data privacy.  © 2022 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151693597"

To enable and accelerate digital industrial transformation, it is vital to support cost-efficient Industry 4.0 application development. However, the development of such Industry 4.0 applications is currently expensive due to the limitations of existing IoT platforms in representing complex industrial machines, the support of only production line-based application testing, and the lack of cost models for application cost/benefit analysis. In this paper, we propose the use of Cyber Twins (CTs), an extension of Digital Twins, to support cost-efficient Industry 4.0 application development. CTs provide semantic descriptions of the machines they represent and incorporate machine simulators that enable application testing without any production line risk and cost. This paper focuses on CT-based Industry 4.0 application development and the related cost models. Via a case study of a CT-based Industry 4.0 application from the dairy industry, the paper shows that CT-based Industry 4.0 applications can be developed with approximately 60% of the cost of IoT platform-based application development. © by the authors.

For those reasons, this study analyzes the literature according to different industry sectors’ implementations (e.g., food, aerospace and automotive, construction, pharmaceutical, and general manufacturing industries). Additionally, literature concentrated on applications for SC risks is studied. This literature review unveils the current developments of DSCTs in the specific industries covered and risks applications. Hence, this work is intended to help SC practitioners and researchers identify challenges and potential research areas for DSCTs. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140465065"

Developments in Industry 4.0 technologies have made it possible to realize that new quality decision-making process. When that decision-making process is performed under the simulation model of a system developed on real-time data-based and end-to-end connection manner, to prevent the disruption risks and to improve resilience in a system, then it constitutes a digital twin (DT). A DT is a virtual representation of an object or system that can help organizations monitor operations, perform predictive analytics, and improve processes. For instance, a DT could provide a digital replica of the operations of a factory, communications network, or the flow of goods through a supply chain system. In this work, we focus on DT implementations in supply chain networks.

We discuss the characteristics and applications of three important developments that are generating transformative change in the management of supply chains and business operations—Cloud-based systems, Digital Platforms, and Digital Twins. The cloud provides computer resources and computing services via the Internet. It has changed the economics of IT, enabling easy access to vast computing resources and the elastic scalability of IT solutions to match demand. Migration to the cloud is strongly affecting corporate IT strategies. Rapid developments in Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) include Enterprise Resource Planning applications offered through various modes of cloud delivery. Digital platforms have changed the nature of markets in many sectors, most notably across the retail economy. As well as facilitating commercial transactions, digital platforms can also nurture business ecosystems that support product and service innovation. Cloud Manufacturing offers the potential to deliver Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS) through a platform.

One of the reasons for the suboptimal adoption of hyperautomation is the large gap between current theoretical frameworks and practical methodologies and tools that can be applied in a real industrial production scenario. This situation has become much more complicated in high-tech enterprises, which face a particular set of issues in terms of innovation, cost-effectiveness, and supply chain management in today's globalized environment. This manuscript provides a new conceptual business framework and technological background for achieving sustainable hyperautomation in the manufacturing of linear electromechanical actuators (LEMA), a key component of several cyberphysical actuators. A set of digital tools and innovative concepts, such as intra-enterprise 3-level factory and definitive designs based on unified solutions, which enable mass customization and offer up to 1000 variants of the LEMAs, are introduced to achieve synergistic interaction between different business functions and provide significant cost and technological advantages. To make manufacturing more customizable, a modular design approach is used, and simultaneously, to facilitate mass production, the focus is given on roller screw transmission modules, representing approximately three-fourths of the added value of LEMA. Furthermore, the concept of synergetic forward integration is proposed and explained using an example of robotic resistance spot welding. This framework involves a closed loop of industrial mature digital tools that enables autonomous product design and manufacturing via Responsive R&D (Research and Development) and feedback-driven dynamic interactions with the market and production system. These steps allow intelligent and automatic decision making throughout the digitally connected systems within the company and out of the company through a digital networked connected intra-enterprise world inside the supply chain with minimal human intervention.  © 2013 IEEE.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139259776"

To increase their overall resilience against such unexpected disruptions, traditional approaches are no longer sufficient. To date, research on supply chain resilience has mainly focused on reactive responses and recovery strategies (post-disruption). Hence, the research gap addressed in this paper is that of identifying new and proactive strategies to enable pre-emptive resilience in military supply chains (pre-disruption). In this paper, the authors first provide a critical review of the pertinent literature and research conducted over the past 12 years. Following on from there, they identify new research directions for enabling pre-emptive resilience to aid military logistic planners in monitoring supply chains and strategic decision-making to maintain their resilience. © 2022 The Authors.

In the interaction process, delays are frequently unseen and therefore unforeseen, and their impacts are not considered as losses or as potential areas for improvement. As a result, the goal of this paper is to design a conceptual model to calculate delays impacts in decision-making interactions between humans and computerized systems. The model considers the sum of delays that occur due to various reasons; these include human delays, interface delays, and computer delays. Moreover, the conceptual model is applied in a supply chain system in which different human decisions interact with the digital planning model of an automotive manufacturer. The purpose of the simulation model is to quantify the loss and improvement potentials depending on the decision process delays in capacity measures in strategic, tactical, and operational planning horizons based on a defined target system. The results obtained show how delays significantly affect the supply chain performance. Finally, a methodological approach is presented for assessing the impacts of the delays in a sensitivity analysis. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127174224"

This paper develops a novel framework for exploring the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies for improving SROP. It highlights current best-practice examples and presents future research pathways. Design/methodology/approach: This viewpoint paper argues how Industry 4.0 technology adoption can enable effective SROP in the post-COVID-19 era. Academic articles, relevant grey literature, and insights from industry experts are used to support the development of the framework. Findings: Seven technologies are identified that bring transformational capabilities to SROP, i.e. big data analytics, digital twins, augmented reality, blockchain, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things. It is demonstrated how these technologies can help to improve three sub-themes of organisational social performance (employment practices, health and safety, and business practices) and three sub-themes of community social performance (quality of life and social welfare, social governance, and economic welfare and growth). Research limitations/implications: A research agenda is outlined at the intersection of Industry 4.0 and SROP through the six sub-themes of organisational and community social performance. Further, these are connected through three overarching research agendas: “Trust through Technology”, “Responsible Relationships” and “Freedom through Flexibility”. Practical implications: Organisational agendas for Industry 4.0 and social responsibility can be complementary. The framework provides insights into how Industry 4.0 technologies can help firms achieve long-term post-COVID-19 recovery, with an emphasis on SROP. This can offer firms competitive advantage in the “new normal” by helping them build back better. Social implications: People and communities should be at the heart of decisions about rethinking operations and supply chains. This paper expresses a view on what it entails for organisations to be responsible for the supply chain-wide social wellbeing of employees and the wider community they operate in, and how they can use technology to embed social responsibility in their operations and supply chains. Originality/value: Contributes to the limited understanding of how Industry 4.0 technologies can lead to socially responsible transformations. A novel framework integrating SROP and Industry 4.0 is presented. © 2022, Deepak Ram Asokan, Fahian Anisul Huq, Christopher M.

Our analysis to the triple crisis that the world is experiencing as a result of COVID-19 has enabled us to identify several challenges to overcome for current decision-making systems and industrial environments that are constrained to develop adaptative management systems, flexible networks and smart business continuity plans. The impacts of both geospatial and business intelligence as well as advanced simulation have motivated our proposition of a new generic framework based on digital twins to deal with these challenges. Our proposed framework by combining first digital twins with business intelligence tools aims to develop smart information models, value-driven DT architectures and context aware services that tries to mimic real-environment dynamics, and according to its developed smart engines prevent the occurrence of unpredictable events. Secondly, by integrating to this combination, location intelligence provides multi-perspective modelling and geo-statistic data integration with real-time operational data into digital twins offers a generic system for prognostication, optimization and on-line and offline learning.

Failure to effectively manage the growing complexity has undermined even companies with best-of-breed quality systems, denting brand equity and depressing sales. Unmanaged complexity is a risk factor for product development and manufacturing supply chains, threatening growth potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) that depends on products becoming smart and connected. Traditional product development organizations plan for a linear increase in the number of components and modules but not an exponential increase in possible interactions due to software.

Furthermore, functions have increased with the development of industrial revolutions, however, many manufacturing organizations have not realized their full potential. As a result, many industrial organizations do not know why, where, and when the existing functions and projects for implementing new functions fail where tactical and strategic functions of a manufacturing organization are commonly over-seen. Thus, the aim of this research was to propose a holistic approach for manufacturing organizations in order to model their functions enabling the assessment, design, management, and control of operations and performance as well as to identify improvement potentials. For this purpose, a conceptual model was developed based on the evolution of functions along with the industrial revolutions. Moreover, using the conceptual model, manufacturing organizations can be modeled, considering common organizational functions in the respective areas of production, maintenance, and quality, etc., in the three planning horizons—strategic, tactical, and operative. As a result, the model serves as a basis for the integral management and control of manufacturing organizations. Moreover, it can be also used as a basis framework for a digital twin model for organizations. Thus, a system dynamics simulation model based on the conceptual model was developed for a generic organization. The goal of the simulation model is to provide an exemplary digital model of a manufacturing organization in which the different functions are applied with different methods, systems, and/or individuals along the development phases. © 2022 by the authors.

This paper outlines how Life-Cycle emissions data is accurately calculated for specific steel producers, reinforcing products and fabrication, how 3rd party verification provides confidence in it and how an innovative collaboration is developing a solution that aims to digitise the steel reinforcing steel supply chain so this information can be used by design engineers and other construction stakeholders to help drive down emissions. The paper explains describes digitally connection of numerous discrete construction project IT systems to systems used in the material supply chain, enabling the assurance and compliance evidence for a safety critical product such as reinforcing steel to be utilised throughout the process. This is laying the foundation to create a digital twin of the built assets with accurate reinforcing steel information being traced from as-designed 3D Building Information Management models (BIM) through manufacturing, robotic-driven fabrication and installation, to as-built BIM models for handover. Upfront ‘embodied’ carbon emissions – measured as its Global Warming Potential (in CO2e per tonne of reinforcing product)-and other environmental data, held within a fully verified Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) will flow through this system enabling the easier identification and selection of lower emission concrete reinforcement and the accurate calculation of asset level embodied emissions. This in turn can improve the scores available within ‘Green’ building and infrastructure rating systems and can support sound decision making in the race to Net-Zero. © Fédération Internationale du Béton – International Federation for Structural Concrete.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143915428"

We design digital twins to represent a certain volume of non-fungible gas. We track the digital twin of a molecule, tagged with metadata. The purpose of our technical development is to create a ""digital asset"" (DA); a virtual representation of a volume of LNG associated with a specific LNG cargo, reflecting specific green attributes. The DA can be split into phases, corresponding to LNG supply chain steps, to represent a specific volume of GHG emitted. Our model incorporates the possibility for LNG stakeholders to offset and compensate GHG emitted they are directly/indirectly responsible for and/or accountable for. Additionally, LNG Stakeholders can interact on a specific volume (parceled), differentiating the same molecules of gas (fungible) with specific green attributes (non-fungible). We developed innovative digital assets' features: - Fractionable (dividable digital asset, for a specific volume of LNG); - Transferable (change of ownership, for traceability along all value chain); - Transactional & Valuable (a Premium offers with evidence of low emission); and, Stackable (rewards mechanisms). This permits to provide a life-time value oriented service in a dynamic multi-actors model, to incentivize sustainable LNG with a premium, and value non-tangible assets. Lastly, we programmed a redistribution mechanism, governed by smart contracts, to transfer collected fees (value pool) to local communities, triggering positive impacts; contributing to UN SDGs achievement. Our Blockchain solution aims to establish a single origin of truth to provide LNG buyers and sellers with a decentralized interoperable view of carbon-neutral LNG cargoes; offering new capabilities to tackle issues LNG players are dealing with: clear delineation, silos approach (vs. collaborative), authoritative single source of information, data transparency, identified legitimate users, added-value generation; premium (attached/detached) in case of re-export, co-purchasing, borrowing & lending; and attribution of benefits of auditable emission intensities, including to big industrial gas consumers. LNG players can help entities meet their net-zero commitments by sourcing green LNG; supporting companies for their green/carbon neutral initiatives throughout the whole supply chain.

As a snowball, in a globally interconnected world, such problems have been gradually amplified while moving downstream SCs. Both academia and business have provided suggestions to support companies to overcome the challenges they were facing. However, there is still no consensus regarding what and how technologies could support practitioners to become more resilient. In this research, the authors clustered 3 areas of interest in response to the issue abovementioned: 1) Approach to activities, 2) SC enhancement and 3) Digitalization. Hence, these clusters were detailed into solutions to be adopted that support companies in achieving a resilient network. In particular, the authors focused on how Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) may support manufacturing firms to solve the challenges they faced throughout the pandemic. Hence, this research aims at proposing an updated framework about the state-of-the-art of ANN applications in manufacturing, proposing twelve fields of application to support operations. These algorithms must be integrated with seven technologies: Industrial Analytics, Additive Manufacturing (AM), Process Management, Advanced Automation, Cloud Manufacturing (CM), Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Advanced Human Machine Interface (HMI), and Digital Twin (DT) and related applications. Finally, the research aims at suggesting a prioritization of the solutions to be introduced within companies, identifying smart manufacturing technologies as priorities in building a more resilient network, all stand out Additive Manufacturing, Digital Twin and Industrial Internet of Things. © 2022, AIDI - Italian Association of Industrial Operations Professors.

Machine learning models are increasingly powering digital twins because of their ability to capture the complexity of the physical world with fidelity. However, machine learning models fall short when predicting beyond the experience of past data. Today's production systems and supply chains are navigating disruptions that they have not experienced previously. This research is motivated by the necessity to explore methods for managing large-scale disruptions outside the “learned” experience of both the data and the control strategy of the production system. To explore the interaction of human and machine intelligence in managing disruptions, this paper builds on ongoing work by the authors to develop a framework integrating production and logistics processes that employs a machine learning-enabled digital twin to ensure adaptive production scheduling and resilient supply chain operations.

Such crucial infrastructure systems, such as nuclear power plants, rely on the efficient completion of maintenance tasks (MTs) to achieve high reliability with minimal downtime. Managers often wish for a 'crystal ball' that can enable them to configure their resources optimally. However, the MTs are inevitably encountered by various uncertainties rooted in intrinsic equipment failures, endogenous factors (e.g., staffing), and exogenous factors (e.g., supply chain disruptions). Thus, it is challenging to manage these tasks. The proposed SDT can serve as a 'crystal ball' to gain insights into resource configurations, staff planning, and task scheduling, thanks to the versatility of simulation. This feasibility study uses both a data-driven framework and stochastic modeling methods to construct the SDT. Initial results indicate the SDT can produce reliable results comparable to the test dataset retrospectively, and it can be used to minimize the time in system of the MTs, while maximizing the throughput within a specific time frame.  © 2022 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147429505"

This disruption can be fatal for production, logistics, and retail operations. Depending on the scope of the affected areas and the blackout duration, supply chains (SC) can be impacted to different extent. In this study, we perform a simulation analysis using anyLogistix digital SC twin to identify potential impacts of blackouts on SCs for scenarios of different severity. Distinctively, we triangulate the design and evaluation of experiments with consideration of SC performance, resilience, and viability. The results allow for some generalizations. First, we conceptualize blackout as a special case of SC risks which is distinctively characterized by a simultaneous shutdown of several SC processes, disruption propagations (i.e., the ripple effect), and a danger of viability losses for entire ecosystems. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of blackouts, mitigation and recovery strategies. The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the dynamics of the power loss propagation across different regions, the blackout duration, simultaneous unavailability of supply and logistics along with the unpredictable customer behavior might become major factors that determine the blackout impact and influence selection of an appropriate recovery strategy. The outcomes of this research can be used by decision-makers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of blackouts on the SCs and viability and develop mitigation and recovery strategies. The paper is concluded by summarizing the most important insights and outlining future research agenda toward SC viability, reconfigurable SC, multi-structural SC dynamics, intertwined supply networks, and cross-structural ripple effects. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131301774"

For a concept that is so inconsistently defined in the literature, it has been used for many applications, especially in manufacturing, production, and operations. DT not only allows for supervision and running simulations, but it also supports AI applications since it is mapped to all types of data and Intel on the physical object. On the other hand, warehouses have been subject to little digitization over the years. Warehouse management is at the very core of both manufacturing and retail operations, ensuring supply chain and production continuity. It is also a conjunction of uncertain material handling activities. It could easily benefit from the Information visibility and the smart features supplied by digital twins and machine learning. In this perspective, this paper examines the use cases of warehouse digital twins (WDT). This study aims to assess the maturity of AI application within WDT, namely techniques, objectives, and challenges. Consequently, inconsistencies are identified and research gaps are presented, making way for future development and innovation. © 2022 The Authors.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142910303"

Development of CE design standards A literature review in each challenge area identifies future research areas. Finally, a preliminary circular product design convergence model is introduced to illustrate a CE consumer product design system that addresses the challenges and research opportunities. The work contributes a framework within which product design can be improved to aid in the realization of Design-for-the-CE. The circular product design convergence model can be a framework for exploring standards-driven and validated solutions to these challenges.

How, in this context, the question of the composition of digital twins to model a system of systems, where each system already has its own digital twin?

The shift has been attributed to the design of hyper-cognitive systems, integration of virtual and extended reality, digital machinery prototyping and twin designs, trusted machine boundaries, collaborative robots, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based supply chains. This new wave, termed Industry 5.0, is expected to leverage massive production with user-centric customization outside the scope of Industry 4.0 ecosystems. Industry 5.0 is expected to assist diverse industrial verticals like healthcare, smart farming, drones, smart grids, and supply chain production ecosystems. However, data is shared among multiple heterogeneous networks, spanning different authoritative domains. Thus, trusted and secured data transfer is crucial to synergize and secure the industrial perimeters. Blockchain (BC) is a preferred choice as a security enabler to Industry 5.0 ecosystems owing to its inherent property of immutability, chronology, and auditability in industrial systems. Limited works are proposed that present the vision and holistic view of BC-assisted Industry 5.0 applications. The article presents a first-of-its-kind survey on BC as a security enabler in Industry 5.0. Based on a descriptive survey methodology and research questions, we presented the key drivers, and potential applications, and propose an architectural vision of BC-based Industry 5.0 in diverse applicative verticals. The survey intends to present solutions that would assist industry practitioners, academicians, and researchers to drive novel BC-assisted solutions in Industry 5.0 verticals.  © 2013 IEEE.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133771325"

Moreover, modern digital technologies, such as the use of digital twin technology, can increase the use of geographically dispersed work teams and contribute to sustainable value creation in the future. However, the digital transition creates new organizational models and influences relationships in supply chains, thus affecting structural changes in business models. Hence, the study aims to investigate, from the whole value chain perspective, how the next generation of digital services is affecting business value and changing the business model concept. In addition, this paper discusses the stakeholder and social responsibility value creation perspective on business model for integrated sustainable value creation. To investigate this, it was decided to use a quantitative methodology in the form of questionnaires, which were distributed among different interested parties: two contractors, three suppliers, and an operator. The results indicated that all respondents, such as an operator, shipping companies, and subsea service providers, are positive about future digital technologies, which should ensure environmental sustainability, improve human interaction and communication. At the same time, they emphasize the importance of integrated join work within the value creation element. Overall, all participants are interested in reducing costs, they expect initiatives from each other in offering sustainable and innovative solutions, and to achieve these, innovative cooperation is needed. © Viktoriia Koilo, 2022","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124119453"

Multiple pickers work simultaneously in the picking area to respond to customer orders “as soon as possible”. To do so, company policies are devised to meet performance requirements, while guaranteeing minimum interference among pickers. Here we model a person-to-goods manual system by means of an event graph (EG). An EG-based representation covers the event-driven logic of the picking system, as well as the need of providing a highly-detailed description of the system logic. EGs also represent the common ground for integrating complementary analysis techniques, such as discrete-event simulation, digital twins and process mining, which allows to move towards a truly connected supply chain. We then resort to simulation to exploit the benefit of replacing a time-free order behavior with a time-window based organization for order collection.

However, even after more than 10 years of the technology’s existence, it is barely used for any self-sustaining applications. This raises the question of why BC cannot prevail against its alternatives. With this paper we want to identify criteria by which the added value of BCT can be measured. Furthermore, we want to evaluate how well the different supply chains (SC) exploit the added values of BCT. Methods: For this, we identified real-world examples and case studies for luxury, food, and healthcare SCs. These examples are described in detail and then analyzed for their added value compared to possible alternatives. Results: The results show that in the clusters of food and healthcare SCs, no general added value of BC over current best-practice solutions could be verified. Luxury SCs manage valuable products that are typically traded in small quantities. It is within this cluster that the implementation of BC can be justified best. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study shows that the application of BCT is especially beneficial for goods with a high value and low trade volume. In addition, the interface between reality and the digital twin should be as secure as the database or BC solution itself. Furthermore, the demand for transparency and immutability of data should be more important than the need to protect sensitive data. Finally, SC participants, especially the end customer, must also be able to appreciate the advantages of BCT. © 2021 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126601644"

A smart production planning and control process must successfully address both risks by reducing them, thereby strengthening supply chain (SC) resilience and its ability to survive in the long term. On the one hand, the antidisruptive potential and the inherent sustainability implications of the zero-defect manufacturing (ZDM) management model should be highlighted. On the other hand, the digitization and virtualization of processes by Industry 4.0 (I4.0) digital technologies, namely digital twin (DT) technology, enable new simulation and optimization methods, especially in combination with machine learning (ML) procedures. This paper reviews the state of the art and proposes a ZDM strategy-based conceptual framework that models, optimizes and simulates the master production schedule (MPS) problem to maximize service levels in SCs. This conceptual framework will serve as a starting point for developing new MPS optimization models and algorithms in supply chain 4.0 (SC4.0) environments. © 2021 by the authors.

Every company usually has a web presence, related documents, web pages and a trace on the web, which can be used for an initial structure of the digital twin. Hereby, first services for the correlations between partner companies and requirements can be designed.

To cope with those challenges, digital twins that create a digital representation of physical entities by integrating real-time and real-world data seem to be a promising approach. This paper aims to provide an overview of digital twin applications in the food industry and analyze their challenges and potentials. Therefore, a literature review is executed to examine digital twin applications in the food supply chain. The applications found are classified according to a taxonomy and key elements to implement digital twins are identified. Further, the challenges and potentials of digital twin applications in the food industry are discussed. The survey revealed that the application of digital twins mainly targets the production (agriculture) or the food processing stage. Nearly all applications are used for monitoring and many for prediction. However, only a small amount focuses on the integration in systems for autonomous control or providing recommendations to humans. The main challenges of implementing digital twins are combining multidisciplinary knowledge and providing enough data. Nevertheless, digital twins provide huge potentials, e.g., in determining food quality, traceability, or designing personalized foods. © 2021 by the authors.

The article discusses non-destructive quality control methods based on the process of modeling digital twins and the authors' approach proves the advantages of just such an innovative concept of expanding the definition of logistics network digital twin in comparison with the traditional methods of non-destructive quality control. It could be shown that this approach eventually leads the ability of industries to switch to digitalization of their processes. Saying precisely the improving of the quality control methods could be treated as digitalization of their supply chains, reflecting the entire product life cycle. We have displayed a digital supply chain, which includes the method of non-destructive testing, like a digital twin.

However, a lack of integration spanning these individual frameworks can be observed. In this conceptual paper, we hypothesize that reconfigurability can be considered such an integral perspective that consolidates the research in SC adaptation to ever changing environments. We theorize a new notion – a Reconfigurable SC or the X-network–that exhibits some crucial design and control characteristics for complex value-adding systems in highly vulnerable environments. We support our argumentation and conceptual viewpoints by a literature analysis along with tertiary studies to review and structure contextual factors of designing the X-networks. We propose respective frameworks and discuss the implementation principles and technologies at the macro and micro levels. Two novel concepts–dynamic SC meta-structures and dynamic autonomous services–are introduced. Distinctively, we go beyond the existing knowledge to predict proactively the future directions in the reconfigurable SCs. Our results can be of value for decision-makers to decipher chances and barriers in contemporary SC transformations. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086655436"

The Internet of things is also very helpful in developing sustainable products. Digital and IoT twins in product design can help manufacturers determine the energy impact and resource utilization of the equipment they manufacture, as well as determine legality. With smart design, manufacturers can create devices that produce less energy and less waste. They can use digital modeling tools to help manufacturers, correct design errors, and save on maintenance and repair costs to identify potential problems. Organizations can identify ways to improve the Internet of things. The supply chain is intended on the basis of each product line and segment, allowing for the unique product information found in the chain to be fully customized and used in the market. This paper reviews various strategies of optimization of energy requirements in smart houses/buildings by improving device efficiency, and by emphasizing on the necessity of balancing the resources required for the IoT infrastructure and reducing the environmental costs. Optimization through simple design has been adopted as the finest strategy for regulating and planning energy consumption. This sudden increase in usage of IoT technology has impacted vividly on the renewable energy requirements and its consumption efficiencies. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103272160"

At the same time, energy demand has dramatically increased in global mining operations also intensifying economic pressure. Surprisingly, the recapturing of important raw materials at the end of the product life cycle through recycling is still insufficiently implemented in the supply chain. Recycling is not only a sink for unwanted materials it can become an urban mine. This is especially relevant in Europe, where in comparison to other continents primary raw material mining of bulk materials is rather low. In a situation of scarcity, the exact planning of raw material and material flows for the following months (and sometimes years) has become ever more vital to ensure their timely and sufficient availability for production. A missing piece is the necessary transfer of production information (like bill of materials, BOM) to the recycler because information is typically kept inside the production supply chain. Digital technologies such as Digital Twins can help provide this information to the End-of-Life (EoL) stakeholders (recycling industry) as a means to increase the potential of circular economy. This paper establishes urban mining as an important concept of life cycle management in the circular economy. It uses a case study approach to explore the potential of urban mining for resource savings. The authors demonstrate that urban mining represents a high-impact application of sustainable engineering within life cycle management where Digital Twins help increase impact on sustainability. © 2020 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093067590"

The present study focuses on the End-of-Life (EoL) decision-making for built facilities, including buildings and infrastructure, to support such a shift. We look at the involved EoL decisions through the lens of ‘information requirements’ and try to envision an information supply chain, in parallel with the facilities’ lifecycle stages, to support such decisions. We examine available data acquisition techniques, data analysis tools, and information standards that can help in creating and maintaining an up-to-date view of the built facility’s materials/components/ subsystems and their location, condition, residual value, remaining life, second life attributes, etc. through digital twins.

Global players implement their own solutions based on the state of the art technologies.

This paper presents a novel, working, reliable, low-cost, scalable solution for asset tracking, supporting global asset management for Industry4.0. The solution uses high accuracy indoor positioning—based on Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radio technology—combined with RFID-based tracking features.

Modern production environments are frequently subject to disruptions and consequent modifications. As a result, the development of digital twins of manufacturing systems cannot rely solely on manual operations. Recent contributions proposed approaches to exploit data for the automated generation of the models. However, the resulting representations can be excessively accurate and may also describe activities that are not significant for estimating the system performance. Generating models with an appropriate level of detail can avoid useless efforts and long computation times, while allowing for easier understanding and re-usability. This paper proposes a method to automatically discover manufacturing systems and generate adequate digital twins. The relevant characteristics of a production system are automatically retrieved from data logs. The proposed method has been applied on two test cases and a real manufacturing line. The experimental results prove its effectiveness in generating digital models that can correctly estimate the system performance. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100502662"

Among these, the digital twin technology is characterized as a paradigm shift in managing production and supply networks since it facilitates a high degree of surveillance and a communication platform between humans, machines, and parts. Digital twins can play a critical role in facilitating faster decision making in product trade-ins by nearly eliminating the uncertainty in the conditions of returned end-of-life products. This paper demonstrates the potential effects of digital twins in trade-in policymaking through a simulated product-recovery system through blockchain technology. A discrete event simulation model is developed from the manufacturer's viewpoint to obtain a data-driven trade-in pricing policy in a fully transparent platform. The model maps and mimics the behavior of the product-recovery activities based on predictive indicators. Following this, Taguchi's Orthogonal Array design is implemented as a design-of-experiment study to test the system's behavior under varying experimental conditions. A logistics regression model is applied to the simulated data to acquire optimal trade-in acquisition prices for returned end-of-life products based on the insights gained from the system. © 2020 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088022589"

The tradeoff is that this minimum number of resources must guarantee a good service for the patients, represented by the time spent in the system and in the queue. The goal is to develop a digital twin which integrates the physical and virtual systems and allows a real‐time mapping of the patient flow to create a sustainable and dynamic vaccination center. Firstly, to reach this goal, a discrete‐event simulation model is implemented. The simulation model is integrated with a mobile application that automatically collects time measures. By processing these measures, indicators can be computed to find problems, run the virtual model to solve them, and replicate improvements in the real system. The model is tested in a South Tyrol vaccination clinic and the best configuration found includes 31 operators and 306 places dedicated for the queues. This configuration allows the vaccination of 2164 patients in a 10‐h shift, with a mean process time of 25 min.

It influences the economically and ecologically successful execution of processes such as recondi-tioning and the corresponding supply chain management. Digitization concepts, such as digital twins, enable the relevant information to be made available to the right actor at the right time in a decentralized manner. It is assumed that digital twins will play an important role in the future and can contribute, among other things, to the successful implementation of circular economy strategies. However, there is no uniform definition of the term digital twin yet and the exploration and use of digital twins in the context of circular economy products and supply chains is still in its infancy. This article presents potential contributions of digital twins to the circularity of products and the management of circular supply chains. To this end, the derivation and validation of a definition for the term digital twin is described. A stakeholder analysis with a special focus on the processes of the individual stakeholders results in an overview of potentials and information requirements of circular supply chains for a digital twin. The paper concludes that circular supply chains can benefit from digital twins, but that there is still a need for research and development, particularly regarding product and use case‐specific implementations of the concept. © 2021 by the authors.

The digital-twin based architecture will enable manufacturers to proactively manage supply chain risk in an increasingly complex and dynamic environment. This integrated framework enables “sense-and-respond” capabilities, i.e. the ability to sense potential supplier and production risks that affect ultimate delivery to the customer, to update anticipated customer delivery dates, and recommend mitigating steps that minimize any anticipated disruption. In its core functionality this framework senses disruptions at a supplier facility that cascade down the upstream supply chain and employs the predictive capabilities of its machine learning-based engine to trigger and support adaptive changes to the manufacturer’s MES system. Any changes to the production schedule that cannot be accommodated in a revised schedule are propagated across the downstream supply chain alerting end customers to any changes. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115272178"

The research reported in this Chapter explores how current digital techniques build on established capabilities to provide important examples of resource flows in the global food system. The use of geographic information and Digital Twins are tested where the importance of using robust metrics and their data content are defined. This approach also describes how metrics of connectiveness between resources are being used to identify critical controlling points in resource flows where sustainable outcomes are possible. The Chapter will define the global resource flows of agriculture and food production in the worldwide system that are now the focus of new circular economies and carbon-zero programs. The terms carbon neutral, carbon zero, and climate-neutral refer to the same outcome. The approach is to review long term data and study existing applications that assess how nutrients flow through food supply chains to their eventual consumption as the food and beverage products that make up our diets. The analysis presented in this Chapter will show how technologies and models can be used to identify systemic interventions by companies and operators in the global marketplace. They will demonstrate the delivery of environmentally climate-smart food production that increases carbon responsibility; regional food solutions that enable access and affordability; and, supply chains that provide consumers with product assurance and nutrition for healthy lifestyles. A specific focus is the ‘middle’ part of food supply chains, these are the food and beverage manufacturing functions where product development decisions will become a reality. The requirement to build-in sustainability and circularity into these operations is of extreme importance in meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals, providing a circular economy, and reaching more carbon-neutral outcomes. This Chapter develops geographic information, supply chain models and Digital Twins to demonstrate the potential of using them to define and measure resource flows in the global food system. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140872515"

The COVID-19 pandemic reaffirmed that the biomedical production value-chain is vulnerable to disruption and has been under attack from sophisticated nation-state adversaries. Current cyber defenses are inadequate, and the integrity of critical production systems and processes are inherently vulnerable to cyber-attacks, human error, and supply chain disruptions. The following chapter explores how a BioSecure Digital Twin will improve U.S. manufacturing resilience and preparedness to respond to these hazards by significantly improving monitoring, integrity, security, and agility of our manufacturing infrastructure and systems. The BioSecure Digital Twin combines a scalable manufacturing framework with a robust platform for monitoring and control to increase U.S. biopharma manufacturing resilience. Then, the chapter discusses some of the inherent vulnerabilities and challenges at the nexus of health and advanced manufacturing. Next, the chapter highlights that as the Pandemic evolves, we need agility and resilience to overcome significant obstacles. This section highlights an innovative application of Cyber Informed Engineering to developing and deploying a BioSecure Digital Twin to improve the resilience and security of the biopharma industrial supply chain and production processes. Finally, the chapter concludes with a process framework to complement the Digital Twin platform, called the Biopharma (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) OODA Loop Framework (BOLF), a four-step approach to decision-making outputs from the Digital Twin.

Although these strategies are proposed and developed under different backgrounds, their common objective is to achieve intelligent manufacturing, which has the potential to revolutionise manufacturing industry and is being nurtured through national projects such as ""Industry 4.0"" in Germany, ""Made Smarter"" in the UK, ""Industrial Internet"" in the US, and ""Intelligent Manufacturing"" in China, etc. These projects promote a new manufacturing philosophy to guide the development of industrial manufacturing in a digital, intelligent and networked global environment, as well as upgrade the traditional manufacturing to intelligent manufacturing. With taking advantages of artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing technologies, intelligent manufacturing connects all manufacturing facilities and enables physical processes and information flows to be available when and where they are needed across holistic manufacturing supply chains, this will benefit optimizing manufacturing resources, improving product quality, system productivity and sustainability, and reducing costs. Intelligent manufacturing has attracted intense attention due to the broad application of artificial intelligence and information science technology in manufacturing industry. In this study, 1370 papers in intelligent manufacturing are taken as data sources, which are retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection Database between 1987 to 2017. The present paper aims to reveal the development status, the number of documents by leading countries, hotspots and trends of intelligent manufacturing by VOSviewer tool. Based on annual outputs and growth rate of literatures, the initial development stage (1987-1997), the stable development stage (1998-2012) and the rapid development stage (2013-2017) of intelligent manufacturing are proposed. On the whole, to date, China takes a leading position out of more than 100 countries or regions, followed by America and England. With more than 30 years of evolution, the connotation of intelligent manufacturing mainly goes through the process from digitalization to networking and then to intellectualization. In the recent research (since 2013), new enabling technologies for intelligent manufacturing have been developed, including Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Digital Twin (DT), Cloud Manufacturing, and Cyber-Physical System (CPS), which endow the manufacturing process with intelligence. For instance, IoT devices can communicate and interact with each other, and thus enable the real-time monitoring and dynamic control. Big data analytics together with AI can help to mine out potential rules, knowledge and patterns, in order to smart prediction, evaluation, optimization and decision-making. DT aims at constructing interactive virtual mirrors for physical assets and fusing both real and simulated data to give more insights. Cloud Manufacturing transforms manufacturing resources and manufacturing capabilities into manufacturing services, which can be managed and operated in an intelligent and unified way to enable the full sharing and circulating of manufacturing resources and manufacturing capabilities. These technologies can be combined with each other and greatly promote the innovation of manufacturing in design, production, operation and maintenance, etc. The findings presented in this study reveal the technical developing tendency and current hot topics in intelligent manufacturing and will facilitate scholars' investigation in the related fields, a comprehensive taxonomy of Intelligent Manufacturing can also be developed through analyzing the results of this review. © 2020, Science Press.

In collaboration with a leading supplier of building materials, we explore the opportunities offered by digital silo twin capabilities. Focusing on fill level monitoring we identify diverse opportunities for generating informational, automational and transformational business value.

Leveraging patented technology, the tree to hanger orientation ring (THOR) and tooling were implemented to save CAPEX and OPEX while eliminating risks associated with conventional orientation solutions. An open-water tool installs an external alignment feature onto the wellhead, which is oriented with the tubing hanger already installed in the wellhead. The VXT then orients onto the wellhead with the help of this external alignment feature, resulting in correct orientation with the tubing hanger. This paper discusses the novel technology and its successful development and installation for a subsea project, which revolutionizes the VXT portfolio. Rapid development of THOR technology was required along with expedient project execution. Utilizing digital-twin design techniques such as finite element analysis and operator simulations, the operating life of THOR tooling was investigated in parallel with project engineering. The novel nature of the THOR required unconventional testing, which was performed in-house. Project execution plan was implemented for engineering and manufacturing to successfully build the production equipment on schedule. Comprehensive system integration testing was completed upon the first attempt. The system was deployed to staging facilities before being delivered offshore to the customer and installed subsea in stages during April 2020. Involvement of the operators and installation contractors during the development stage made THOR's first deployment attempt a major success with zero recorded nonproductive time, even during COVID-19. THOR technology reduces the number of components as well as the weight and size of the equipment. The novel THOR equipment can be run by a light intervention vessel rather than conventional equipment, which requires mobile offshore drilling units. The time spent to deploy the VXT system is also reduced, minimizing indirect supply-chain and field-service-related carbon emissions. This further enables reduced carbon emissions and overall carbon footprint of the entire project. The field-proven THOR technology is an evolutionary orientation technology that simplifies the installation operations for the vertical tree and tubing hanger. This technology maintains the robust conventional system configuration post installation and hence does not affect reliability of the VXT system. © 2021, Offshore Technology Conference.

This review analyzes and addresses gaps in modeling supply chain resilience in general and specifically for vaccines in order to guide researchers and practitioners alike to improve critical function of vaccine supply chains in the face of inevitable disruptions. Design/methodology/approach: Systematic review of the literature on modeling supply chain resilience from 2007 to 2020 is analyzed in tandem with the vaccine supply chain manufacturing literature. These trends are then used to apply a novel matrix analysis to seven Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) annual filings of pharmaceutical corporations involved in COVID-19 vaccine manufacture and distribution. Findings: Pharmaceutical corporations favor efficiency as they navigate regulatory, economic and other threats to their vaccine supply chains, neglecting resilience – absorption, adaptation and recovery from inevitable and unexpected disruptions. However, explicitly applying resilience analytics to the vaccine supply chain and further leveraging emerging network science tools found in the academic literature, such as artificial intelligence (AI), stress tests and digital twins, will help supply chain managers to better quantify efficiency/resilience tradeoffs across all associated networks/domains and support optimal system performance post disruption. Originality/value: This is the first review addressing resilience analytics in vaccine supply chains and subsequent extension to operational management through novel matrix analyses of SEC Filings. The authors provide analyses and recommendations that facilitate resilience quantification capabilities for vaccine supply chain managers, regulatory agencies and corporate stakeholders and are especially relevant for pandemic response, including application to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105985701"

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a certain product, such as fresh horticultural produce. This twin is linked to the real-world product by sensors supplying data of the environmental conditions near the target fruit or vegetable. Statistical and data-driven twins quantify how quality loss of fresh horticultural produce occurs by grasping patterns in the data. Physics-based twins provide an augmented insight into the underlying physical, biochemical, microbiological and physiological processes, enabling to explain also why this quality loss occurs. Scope and approach: We identify what the key advantages are of digital twins and how the supply chain of fresh horticultural produce can benefit from them in the future. Key findings and conclusions: A digital twin has a huge potential to help horticultural produce to tell its history as it drifts along throughout its postharvest life. The reason is that each shipment is subject to a unique and unpredictable set of temperature and gas atmosphere conditions from farm to consumer. Digital twins help to identify the resulting, largely uncharted, postharvest evolution of food quality. The benefit of digital twins particularly comes forward for perishable species and at low airflow rates. Digital twins provide actionable data for exporters, retailers, and consumers, such as the remaining shelf life for each shipment, on which logistics decisions and marketing strategies can be based. The twins also help diagnose and predict potential problems in supply chains that will reduce food quality and induce food loss. Twins can even suggest preventive shipment-tailored measures to reduce retail and household food losses. © 2021 The Authors","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099718589"

The features of digital twins range from simulation and analysis to real-time sensor data and system integration. Implementation examples of modeling-oriented twins are becoming commonplace in academic literature, but information management-focused twins that combine multiple systems are scarce. This study presents, analyzes, and draws recommendations from building a multi-component digital twin as an industry-university collaboration project and related smaller works. The objective of the studied project was to create a prototype implementation of an industrial digital twin for an overhead crane called “Ilmatar”, serving machine designers and maintainers in their daily tasks. Additionally, related cases focus on enhancing operation. This paper describes two tools, three frameworks, and eight proof-of-concept prototypes related to digital twin development. The experiences show that good-quality Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are significant enablers for the development of digital twins. Hence, we recommend that traditional industrial companies start building their API portfolios. The experiences in digital twin application development led to the discovery of a novel API-based business network framework that helps organize digital twin data supply chains. © 2021 by the authors.

We conduct a systematic literature review to answer two research questions: 1) whether the information asymmetry in the current remanufacturing supply chain has been resolved; and 2) whether digital twins have a positive impact in solving problems with information asymmetries in remanufacturing supply chains. By analysing 288 articles, we find that, first, this problem remains to be solved, there being two research gaps in particular. Secondly, we find that the digital-twin applications are conducive to solving this problem.

We begin by undertaking a case study of the pharmaceutical drug industry supply chain, exploring both the proposed blockchain initiatives in it initiated by the FDA and startup companies, and the problems in the supply chain that blockchain cannot address. Drawing on this analysis, we derive an endogenous demand for auditing to overcome what we label the “first mile problem” (FMP) with blockchains: ensuring that the data stored on the blockchain distributed ledger is isomorphic with the real life data that it purports to represent. The first mile problem arises only when the blockchain is used to store data about physical items, especially ones involving a service component, rather than being native digital, as is the case with the genesis blockchain application, bitcoin. We show that unless it is feasible to store a “digital twin” of the item (Roberts, 2017), there is a role for auditors, with the training in professional skepticism, to help alleviate the first mile problem. There is no guarantee, however, that this new demand for auditing will be met by the traditional financial statement auditors. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087946255"

Additionally, deployment issues and technologies supporting Digital Twins were reviewed. This study used ATLAS.ti 9 software tools to save, classify, and evaluate the data for this analysis to systematically review the literature. We reviewed, compiled, and sorted papers from 227 publications for this article and then recognized 104 as critical to the work scope; this analysis’ quest date was set from 2002 to 2021. This article represents the first attempt at dealing with the issue of supply chain visibility through the Digital Twins in the logistics field.

The framework consists of two main components: a simulation module and an optimization module. Business processes are modeled as networks of queues through which requests (internal or external to the enterprise) can flow. The digital replica of the business processes creates value by providing a simulation platform upon which to: 1) test optimization strategies, 2) forecast potential delays in requests based on the current state of the real process and the historical data, 3) identify and mitigate bottlenecks, and 4) provide more accurate fulfillment dates to customers. The optimization can be performed offline or in real-time in a feed-back loop as the simulation is being executed. As an integrated simulation and optimization environment, the framework bridges and extends the literature in business process simulation and business process optimization, building upon previous work by the authors that was restricted to only business process scheduling in static deterministic environments. A case study is presented in which three mathematical programming models and a greedy heuristic are compared. A sensitivity study shows the value in using simulation to mitigate operational bottlenecks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111795426"

We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on the global SCs. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model's behavior and its value for decision-makers. The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the timing of the closing and opening of the facilities at different echelons might become a major factor that determines the epidemic outbreak impact on the SC performance rather than an upstream disruption duration or the speed of epidemic propagation. Other important factors are lead-time, speed of epidemic propagation, and the upstream and downstream disruption durations in the SC. The outcomes of this research can be used by decision-makers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and develop pandemic SC plans. Our approach can also help to identify the successful and wrong elements of risk mitigation/preparedness and recovery policies in case of epidemic outbreaks. The paper is concluded by summarizing the most important insights and outlining future research agenda. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081998325"

The last part of the 3rd Industrial Revolution (IR) and the start of the 4th IR gave rise to a world where this overabundance of sensors, and availability of wireless networks enables connections between people and infrastructure that was not practically comprehensible during the 20th century. 4IR supports the datafication of life, data science, big data, transportation evolution, optimization of logistic and supply chains and automation of various aspects of life, including vehicles and road infrastructure. The hyper-connected 4IR environment allows integration between the physical world and digital and intelligent engineering, increasingly serving as the primary lifecycle management systems for engineering practitioners. With this background, the paper evaluates a few concepts of the hyper-connected pavement environment in a 4IR Digital Twin mode, with the emphasis on selected applications, implications, benefits and limitations. The hyper-connected world can and should be managed in the pavement realm to ensure that adequate and applicable data are collected regarding infrastructure, environment and users to enable a more efficient and effective transportation system. In this regard, and planning for future scenarios where the proliferation of data is a given, it is important that pavement engineers understand what is possible, evaluate the potential benefits, conduct cost/benefit evaluations, and implement appropriate solutions to ensure longevity and safety of pavement infrastructure. © 2020, The Author(s).","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098755303"

These features may pose challenges for the efficient operation and management, while manual tasks may significantly increase human errors or near misses, having impact on the propagation of effects and parallel interactions within these systems. In order to handle the aforementioned challenges, a digital twin (DT) integrated in a multi-agent cyber-physical manufacturing system (CPMS) with the help of RFID technology is proposed. The proposed reference architecture tends to improve the trackability and traceability of complex manufacturing processes. In this research work, the interactions occurring both within a single complex manufacturing system and between multiple sites within a supply chain are considered. For the implementation of the integrated DT-CPMS, a simulation model employing the agent-based modelling technique is developed. A case study from a cryogenic supply chain in the UK is also selected to show the application and validity of the proposed digital solution. The results prove that the DT-CPMS architecture can improve system's performance in terms of human, equipment and space utilisations. © 2021 The Authors.

Many virtual systems allow to predict foul conditions, save energy, study special cases, and so on, yet they need to implement new digital tools that allow developing manufacturing process in a better manner. As a result, Digital-Twin platforms are a good alternative since they are virtual models that could receive online and offline data. Thus, programmed algorithms can be evaluated to know the performance of the manufacturing process. These virtualizations and interconnections between elements of the manufacturing process become important components with an increasing role in dealing with supply, production times, and delivery chains as they run in parallel and find optimal performance before implementing these conditions into the real system. This study focuses on the use of a Digital-Twin that integrates a metaheuristic optimization and a direct Simulink model for printed circuit boards (PCB) design and processing focused on the drilling process. The results show that metaheuristic optimization can be integrated into the Digital-Twin concept as part of the production system into the drilling process. In the first part, it shows that depending on the penalization the optimization focuses on the lower path and forgets on changing the tools, yet as the penalization raises it focuses on finishing drilling with one tool before changing. Second, it is important where on the PCB it starts the drilling, with less time depending on each plaque. Third, it can be observed that using optimization can triple the amount of PCBs that can be manufactured. Finally, on an 8-hr run the Digital-Twin that didn’t use optimization can only work with three different designs, differently with optimization it can have 7-8 changes in the PCB design. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100446266"

Essentially this study can be termed as a testimonial for “Digitalize and Transform” initiative. A Production Digital Twin was developed leveraging the IIoT ready shop floor and adopting appropriate digital technologies. The proven DES model and digital twin methodology can be leveraged for future simulations to support market variability. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) method was deployed to create digital models of the shop floor resources and their interplay to help explore the plant characteristics and optimize its performance. The digital simulation model was integrated with the shop floor IIoT framework in a closed-loop, to run experiments and what-if scenarios with variable input parameters. Using this setup, physical shop floor and the digital simulation model share operational data in a continuous closed-loop to provide decision support for improving plant operations. EDM manufacturer’s target was to set up a re-usable DES model to arrive at actionable insights those can help them improve assembly line performance and get ready for the variable demand and product variants that subsequently would help them in driving business and profitability. Significant improvements were realized across all operational indicators—efficiency, quality, productivity and flexibility. Manufacturing SMEs across India are implementing IIoT and data analytics with the objective of acquiring real-time data thus enabling quick and accurate decision making. The closed-loop discrete event simulation methodology has the potential of enhancing IIoT investments further. Especially in the post-COVID scenario, when manufacturers are challenged with disrupted supply-chain, inconsistent demand and manpower shortages, this methodology can help execute shop-floor plans efficiently with optimum resources. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102637973"

This digital transformation not only affects the way products are manufactured but also creates new opportunities for the design of products, processes, services, and systems. Unlike traditional design practices based on system-centric concepts, design for these new opportunities requires a holistic view of the human (stakeholder), artefact (product), and process (realization) dimensions of the design problem. In this paper we envision a “human-cyber-physical view of the systems realization ecosystem,” termed “Design Engineering 4.0 (DE4.0),” to reconceptualize how cyber and physical technologies can be seamlessly integrated to identify and fulfil customer needs and garner the benefits of Industry 4.0. In this paper, we review the evolution of Engineering Design in response to advances in several strategic areas including smart and connected products, end-to-end digital integration, customization and personalization, data-driven design, digital twins and intelligent design automation, extended supply chains and agile collaboration networks, open innovation, co-creation and crowdsourcing, product servitization and anything-as-a-service, and platformization for the sharing economy. We postulate that DE 4.0 will account for drivers such as Internet of Things, Internet of People, Internet of Services, and Internet of Commerce to deliver on the promise of Industry 4.0 effectively and efficiently. Further, we identify key issues to be addressed in DE 4.0 and engage the design research community on the challenges that the future holds.

Conventional oil and gas reserves are finite and are being depleted at a relatively rapid pace. With alternative fuels and technologies still unable to fill the gap, research and development of unconventional petroleum resources have accelerated markedly in the past 20 years. With some of the largest bitumen deposits in the world, Canada has an active oil mining and refining industry. Bitumen deposits, also called oil sands, are formed in complex geological environments and subject to a host of syn-and post-depositional processes. As a result, some ores are heterogeneous, at both individual reservoir and regional scales, which poses significant problems in terms of extractive processing. Moreover, with increased environmental awareness and enhanced governmental regulations and industry best practices, it is critical for oil sands producers to improve process efficiencies across the spectrum. Discrete event simulation (DES) is a computational paradigm to develop dynamic digital twins, including the interactions of critical variables and processes. In the case of mining systems, the digital twin includes aspects of geological uncertainty. The resulting simulations include alternate operational modes that are characterized by separate operational policies and tactics. The current DES framework has been customized to integrate predictive modelling data, generated via partial least squares (PLS) regression, in order to evaluate system-wide response to geological uncertainty. Sample computations that are based on data from Canada’s oil sands are presented, showing the framework to be a powerful tool to assess and attenuate operational risk factors in the extractive processing of bitumen deposits. Specifically, this work addresses blending control strategies prior to bitumen extraction and provides a pathway to incorporate geological variation into decision-making processes throughout the value chain. © 2021 by the authors.

It is characterized by the industrial implementation of breakthrough inventions such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, advanced robots, autonomous vehicles, cloud computing, big data, augmented/simulated reality, 3D printing, blockchain, nanomaterials, and digital twins. Implications & Recommendations: The sooner the inventions and technological phenomena of the fourth industrial revolution will be implemented by particular economies, the sooner the economic effects of this revolution will emerge in the global economy. Contribution & Value Added: The application of breakthrough inventions will cause revolutionary changes in the process of goods production and services, which are synthetically called an intelligent factory and an intelligent supply chain. In addition to the undoubted benefits of - primarily - technical, organizational, and economic nature, many believe that the IR 4.0 will bring threats in the form of rising unemployment, social stratification, threats to cyber security, violations of privacy, ethics, and social norms, a threat of wars based on new inventions and a growing division of the world into rich and poor countries. © 2020, Cracow University of Economics.

However, schedule deviation risks in the logistics process of modular construction can derail its benefits and thus interfere with its widespread application. To address this issue, we aim to develop a digital twin framework for real-time logistics simulation, which can predict potential logistics risks and accurate module arrival time. The digital twin, a virtual replica of the physical module, updates its virtual asset based on building information modeling (BIM) in near real-time using internet of thing (IoT) sensors. Then, the virtual asset is transferred and exploited for logistics simulation in a geographic information system (GIS)-based routing application. We tested this framework in a case project where modules are manufactured at a factory, delivered to the site via a truck, and assembled onsite. The results show that potential logistical risks and accurate module arrival time can be detected via the suggested digital twin framework. This paper’s primary contribution is the development of a framework that mediates IoT, BIM, and GIS for reliable simulation which predicts potential logistics risks and accurate module delivery time. Such reliable risk prediction enables effective supply chain coordination, which can improve project performance and the widespread application of modular construction. © 2021 by the authors.

The implementation of internet of things and artificial intelligence as well as machine learning allows implementing the digital twins. From an economist’s point of view, the digital twin does not make sense without a mathematical model. The study aims at the developing a physical distribution digital twin model being focused on its use in managing trade network activities in conjunction with information cyberspace. The research subject of this paper includes the methodology of the physical distribution formation within the trade network. So, the authors suggest the definition of the investigated physical distribution digital twin (economic) model as a software implementation of the algorithm for processing a set of physical distribution data arriving online and at each moment of time reflecting the activity of the considering trade network. During the research, methods of stochastic modelling and dynamic programming as well as mathematical methods of optimization were used. The results obtained can be incorporated into the algorithmic basis of digital platforms of the trading network ecosystem. The article examines the features of the physical distribution digital twin models from the economic point of view. Taking into account the proposed definition of the digital twin, the future scientific research can cover the development of scientific discussion on questions of optimization methods for the development of the physical distribution within the trade network. © 2021","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106875305"

Digital Twins have been proposed to improve supply chains. However, as of today, they are only used for certain parts of the entire supply chain. This paper presents an initial framework for a holistic Digital Supply Chain Twin (DSCT) capable of including an entire multimodal supply chain. Such a DSCT promises to enable several improvements all across the supply chain while also be capable of simulating and evaluate several different scenarios for the supply chain. Therefore, the DSCT will not only be able to optimize multi- and intermodal supply chains but also makes them potentially more robust by identifying possible issues early on. This paper discusses the major requirements that such a DSCT must fulfil to be useful and how several information technologies that matured in recent years or are about the mature are the key enablers to fulfil these requirements. Finally, a suggested high-level architecture for such a DSCT is presented as a first step towards the realization of a DSCT, as presented in this work. © 2021 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135051556"

Despite a vast range of tests, prototypes, and proof of concepts implemented in the last years, the industrial use of Blockchain technology is still in the early stages. Enabling the interaction of industrial Internet of Things (IOT) platforms with Blockchain might be challenging because standards are still missing in both these technologies. Moreover, integrating productive assets with distributed data exchange and storage technologies is a kind of activity that needs to take into account various aspects, in particular: interoperability, portability, scalability, and security that need to be guaranteed by design. This paper describes the implementation of a portable, platform-agnostic and secure Blockchain Tokenizer for Industrial IOT trustless applications. The Industrial Blockchain Tokenizer (IBT) is based on an industrial data acquisition unit able to gather data from both modern and legacy machines while also interfacing directly with sensors. Acquired data can be processed locally enabling an edge filtering paradigm and then sent to any Blockchain platform. The system has been designed, implemented and then tested on two supply chain scenarios. Tests demonstrated the system capability to act as a bridge between industrial assets and Blockchain platforms enabling the generation of immutable and trust-less “digital twins” for industrial IOT applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076705255"

These operations have increased due to the growth of electronic commerce and direct-to-consumer strategies. We propose a novel data-and model-driven framework to support decision making for urban distribution. The methodology is composed of diverse, hybrid, and complementary techniques integrated by a decision support system. This approach focuses on key elements of megacities such as socio-demographic diversity, portfolio mix, logistics fragmentation, high congestion factors, and dense commercial areas. The methodological framework will allow decision makers to create early warning systems and, with the implementation of optimization, machine learning, and simulation models together, make the best utilization of resources. The advantages of the system include flexibility in decision making, social welfare, increased productivity, and reductions in cost and environmental impacts. A real-world illustrative example is presented under conditions in one of the most congested cities: the megacity of Bogota, Colombia. Data come from a retail organization operating in the city. A network of stakeholders is analyzed to understand the complex urban distribution. The execution of the methodology was capable of solving a complex problem reducing the number of vehicles utilized, increasing the resource capacity utilization, and reducing the cost of operations of the fleet, meeting all constraints. These constraints included the window of operations and accomplishing the total number of deliveries. Furthermore, the methodology could accomplish the learning function using deep reinforcement learning in reasonable computational times. This preliminary analysis shows the potential benefits, especially in understudied metropolitan areas from emerging markets, supporting a more effective delivery process, and encouraging proactive, dynamic decision making during the execution stage. © 2021 by the authors.

The circular economy, the need for optimized material flows, ad-hoc responses and personalization are some of the trends that require supply chains to become “cognitive”, i.e., able to predict trends and flexible enough in dynamic environments, ensuring optimized operational performance. Digital twins (DTs) is a promising technology, and a lot of work is done on the factory level. In this paper, the concept of cognitive digital twins (CDTs) and how they can be deployed in connected and agile supply chains is elaborated. The need for CDTs in the supply chain as well as the main CDT enablers and how they can be deployed under an operational model in agile networks is described. More emphasis is given on the modelling, cognition and governance aspects as well as on how a supply chain can be configured as a network of connected CDTs.

In this paper, we propose blockchain-enabled IHSC and develop a preliminary simulation-based digital twin for this distributed cyber-physical system (CPS) to support the process learning and risk management. Basically, we develop a two-layer blockchain with proof of authority smart contract, which can track the data and key information, improve the supply chain transparency, and leverage local authorities and state regulators to ensure the quality control verification. Then, we introduce a simulation-based digital twin for IHSC management, which can characterize the process spatial-temporal causal interdependencies and dynamic evolution to guide risk control and decision making.

The paper's scientific contribution consists in a holonic control system for multiple robot palletizing cells for product-on-pallet distribution. In this holonic control approach, data-driven digital twins (DT) are created to optimize palletizing schedules, controlled with situation awareness and resource health monitoring. A model-driven DT configuration with embedded simulation faster than real-time is combined with the data-driven DT in a meta-level control scheme offering predictive situation awareness. The paper also presents a pure model-driven DT mock-up of a robot palletizing cell - simulation with software in the loop - in which the actual holonic control system including digital twins and decision making is used in the simulation as it will be deployed in reality. This configuration is used to design the robot palletizing cells, to experiment in limit conditions, to fine tune and validate the robot control solution.  © 2021 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112038873"

In addition, information sharing becomes increasingly decisive for the competition, e.g. in supply networks where products and logistics data such as demands and capacities are exchanged. As many companies are, however, highly reluctant to share data across the supply chain, this paper applies the methodology of design science research to, first, state the requirements for shared digital twins based on five industrial use cases. It turns out that with regard to data decentralism, sovereignty and compatibility through global standardization are key success factors. Hence, second, this paper presents a concept for a shared digital twin providing data on demand, i.e. at the right time and in particular with data condensed to the concrete need. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

Program management justifies this additional investment by arguing that such investments can be expected to produce continuous gains across later phases of the systems life cycle resulting from early detection of defects, risk reduction, improved communication, superior supply chain integration, product line definition, and enhanced traceability. Since systems continue to evolve over their life cycle, system models need to be updated continually to reflect the system's current state and thereby sustain value. However, in today's systems engineering organizations, the current practice is to reallocate modeling resources to other projects once initial modeling on a particular project is completed. This practice results in a resource shortfall that impedes the ability to continuously update system models through the later phases of the system life cycle. This paper presents how digital twin technology can be exploited within MBSE to ensure continuous model updates throughout the system life cycle. This paper also presents preliminary results from prototyping and experiments conducted with a digital twin that is continuously updated with data from the physical system operating in the real world. Finally, this paper shows how operational analysis and system modeling can be significantly enhanced by leveraging digital twin technology within MBSE.  © 2021 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124264442"

Design/methodology/approach: A mixed interpretivist and post-positivist epistemological lens is adopted to pursue the proof-of-concept’s development. From an operational perspective, a synthesis of literature using interpretivism provides the foundation for deductive research inquiry implemented within a case study approach. Within the case study, participatory action research (PAR) is implemented to test the proof of concept via three “waterfall” research phases, namely, literature diagnosis and BIM package selection, BDO development and validation and evaluation. Findings: The findings illustrate that a BDO (which represents the digital twin of manufacturing products) can augment and drive automation processes and workflows for construction product manufacturers within a contractor’s supply chain. The developed framework illustrates the benefits of a BDO, by reducing the number of manufacturing processes to effectively eliminate early errors in the model, generates financial savings and reduces material wastage. Originality/value: This research provides a seminal case study that implements BDO to automate construction product manufacturing processes and demonstrates the utilisation of BDO at an operational (vis-à-vis theoretical) level. Future research is proposed to implement a longitudinal approach to measure and report upon the success (or otherwise) of the proof of concept when implemented on fabrications and shop floor procedures. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079455868"

In the last years, according to some unpredictable events which upset the global economy, supply chain showed the capacity to change itself according to the new constraints but, also, the new opportunities raised. Classical models developed to describe supply chain are not powerful enough to model what today I4.0 pillars allow if we use open innovation as an extraordinary amplifier. Thus, the supply chain changes shape and connections. In this perspective, the paper propose and describe a new construct of supply chain called: Liquid Supply Chain (LiSC). It takes into account also the extraordinary effects of pandemic diffusion of Covid-19 virus and its influence on the companies. A critical comparison with other existing models is proposed and discussed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

This paper aims to demonstrate how a deep reinforcement learning agent based on the proximal policy optimization algorithm can synchronize inbound and outbound flows and support business continuity operating in the stochastic and nonstationary environment if end-to-end visibility is provided. The deep reinforcement learning agent is built upon the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, which does not require hardcoded action space and exhaustive hyperparameter tuning. These features, complimented with a straightforward supply chain environment, give rise to a general and task unspecific approach to adaptive control in multi-echelon supply chains. The proposed approach is compared with the base-stock policy, a well-known method in classic operations research and inventory control theory. The base-stock policy is prevalent in continuous-review inventory systems. The paper concludes with the statement that the proposed solution can perform adaptive control in complex supply chains. The paper also postulates fully fledged supply chain digital twins as a necessary infrastructural condition for scalable real-world applications. © 2021 by the authors.

They are also highly perishable and as such are easily susceptible to spoilage, leading to a reduction in quality attributes and induced food loss. Cold chain technologies have over the years been employed to reduce the quality loss of fruits and vegetables from farm to fork. However, a high amount of losses (≈50%) still occur during the packaging, transportation, and storage of these fresh agricultural produce. This study highlights the current state-of-the-art of various advanced tools employed to reducing the quality loss of fruits and vegetables during the packaging, storage, and transportation cold chain operations, including the application of imaging technology, spectroscopy, multi-sensors, electronic nose, radio frequency identification, printed sensors, acoustic impulse response, and mathematical models. It is shown that computer vision, hyperspectral imaging, multispectral imaging, spectroscopy, X-ray imaging, and mathematical models are well established in monitoring and optimizing process parameters that affect food quality attributes during cold chain operations. We also identified the Internet of Things (IoT) and virtual representation models of a particular fresh produce (digital twins) as emerging technologies that can help monitor and control the uncharted quality evolution during its postharvest life. These advances can help diagnose and take measures against potential problems affecting the quality of fresh produce in the supply chains. Plausible future pathways to further develop these emerging technologies and help in the significant reduction of food losses in the supply chain of fresh produce are discussed. Future research should be directed towards integrating IoT and digital twins in order to intensify real-time monitoring of the cold chain environmental conditions, and the eventual optimization of the postharvest supply chains. This study gives promising insight towards the use of advanced technologies in reducing losses in the postharvest supply chain of fruits and vegetables. © 2020 by the authors.

In the context of buildings and civil infrastructure, the notion of a digital twin remains ill-defined, with little or no consensus among researchers and practitioners of the ways in which digital twin processes and data-centric technologies can support design and construction. This paper builds on existing concepts of Building Information Modeling (BIM), lean project production systems, automated data acquisition from construction sites and supply chains, and artificial intelligence to formulate a mode of construction that applies digital twin information systems to achieve closed loop control systems. It contributes a set of four core information and control concepts for digital twin construction (DTC), which define the dimensions of the conceptual space for the information used in DTC workflows. Working from the core concepts, we propose a DTC information system workflow-including information stores, information processing functions, and monitoring technologies-according to three concentric control workflow cycles. DTC should be viewed as a comprehensive mode of construction that prioritizes closing the control loops rather than an extension of BIM tools integrated with sensing and monitoring technologies. © ","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106009736"

The approach involves incor-porating game design and a building information modelling (BIM) digital twin of a purposed CE prototype building. Our novel approach introduces VR environments designed to provide a visual representation of materials and components that can be reintroduced into the supply chain at the end of life and their removal procedures and material provenance. A case study methodology was applied to a purposely designed CE building, namely the Legacy Living Lab (L3). To reflect the real-life building, L3’s BIM model was combined with Unify game software to advance the literature in three key areas. First, the research investigates VR tools that will allow building designers to view and implement their strategies to advance CE design. Second, this research proposes an advanced VR tool to visualise the bill of quantities (BoQ) and material stock embedded in the studied building, further understanding concepts such as buildings as material banks. Finally, the proposed VR environment defines CE techniques implemented within the case study to be disseminated across the vast construction industry. This VR research identifies three key pillars in reducing the waste gen-erated by the construction industry: education, documentation and visualisation. Furthermore, this paper provides a visual link between the BIM, BoQ and resiliency of the selected materials. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on real-life pandemic scenarios encountered in Germany, we develop and use a discrete-event simulation model to examine SC operations and performance dynamics with the help of anyLogistix digital SC twin. The computational results show that food retail SC resilience at the upheaval times is triangulated by the pandemic intensity and associated lockdown/shutdown governmental measures, inventory-ordering dynamics in the SC, and customer behaviours. We observe that surges in demand and supplier shutdowns have had the highest impact on SC operations and performance, whereas the impact of transportation disruptions was rather low. Transportation costs have spiked because of chaotic inventory-ordering dynamics leading to more frequent and irregular shipments. On bright side, we observe the demand growth and utilization of online sales channels yielding higher revenues. We propose several directions and practical implementation guidelines to improve the food retail SC resilience. We stress the importance of SC digital twins and end-to-end visibility along with resilient demand, inventory, and capacity management. The outcomes of our study can be instructive for enhancing the resilience of food retail SCs in preparation for future pandemics and pandemic-like crises. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110917636"

The resulting increased automation and the improved production synergy between stocks, supply chains and customer demands, come along with the threats and attacks from the Internet. Despite extensive literature on the cybersecurity topic, many actors in manufacturing factories are just realizing the impact of cybersecurity in the preservation of their business. This paper introduces step-by-step the concepts and practical aspects of an Industry 4.0 manufacturing factory that are related to cybersecurity. Based on a subdivision of a typical factory into several generic perimeters, we present the vulnerabilities and threats regarding the network and devices usually found in each perimeter. Therefore, it is more efficient to present the recent proposals of the literature regarding cybersecurity guidelines and solutions in Industry 4.0. Instead of spreading a lot of references regarding every aspect of cybersecurity, we focused on a limited number of papers among the recent references. However, for each paper, we provide the details about the purpose of the proposal, the methodology adopted, the technical solution developed and its evaluation by the authors. These solutions range from classical cybersecurity countermeasures to innovative ones, such as those based on honeypots and digital twins.

Simulation can serve as a powerful foundation for digital twins, as it e. g. allows for probabilistic assessments and multi-dimensional optimization of highly complex and dynamic processes. In this study, a simulation model is developed as part of the EU research and innovation programme Horizon 2020. The goal is to explore the benefits of a simulation-based approach and quantify the potential for later adoption in a scalable Digital Twin system. The model is applied as a case study on a sterile drug product manufacturing line of the Roche Diagnostics GmbH in Mannheim, Germany.

Industries are often faced with supply and demand-related disruptions, leading to production lines unable to cope with material shortage and demand spikes, resulting in missed opportunities or wastage. As a prevailing technology in the manufacturing domain, Digital twins (DT) has the potential to support SC disruption management with real-time connectivity, simulation, and decision support functionalities. Thus, this paper proposes a DT system designed to mitigate SC-related disruptions, and facilitates end-to-end visibility, process streamlining, and solution generation to meet these challenges. A case study featuring an individualized production shop floor is further explored to validate the effectiveness of this DT system in disruption management within the FMCG domain.

The aforesaid assets need a proper representation and it is there where the core of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) comes to the rescue. According to I4.0, every asset (e.g. a machine, software, sensor or actuator, etc.), should be modeled via an Asset Administrative Shell (AAS). AAS is a knowledge structure that provides a description of the asset, its technical functionality and its relationships to other assets. It can be viewed as the as the data model from where the digital twin stems from.

Subsequently, the data supply chain is designed considering the three attributes conceptualization, comparison, and collaboration. Findings: The paper shows how the idea of a data supply chain of a smart factory can be transferred into the building industry. The digital core in terms of a data warehouse monitors material flows according to quantity, location and time and can help to pilot logistics processes.

Furthermore, these terms tend to have definitions evolving through time. Thus, this study explores the use of six data science concepts in research under the framework of Industry 4.0 and supply chain management. To achieve this objective, a text mining approach is employed to both contribute to disambiguation of these terms and identify future research trends.

Digital avatars - sometimes also called Digital Twins or more broadly Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) - are already successfully used in holistic systems for intelligent transport ecosystems, similar to the use of Big Data and artificial intelligence technologies interwoven with modern production and supply chains. The goal of this paper is to describe how data from interwoven, autonomous and intelligent supply chains can be integrated into the diverse data ecosystems of the Industry 4.0, influenced by a multitude of data exchange formats and varied data schemas. In this paper, we describe how a framework for supporting SMEs was established in the Lake Constance region and describe a demonstrator sprung from the framework. The demonstrator project's goal is to exhibit and compare two different approaches towards optimisation of manufacturing lines. The first approach is based upon static optimisation of production demand, i.e. exact or heuristic algorithms are used to plan and optimise the assignment of orders to individual machines.

The traditional clothing product supply chain is difficult to meet consumer's demand of fast fashion. AI and industrial Internet technology, together with intelligent knitting equipments make C2M flexible supply chain possible through digitization. Distributed cloud factory is built as regional node of production supported by digital twin and parallel intelligence. Personalized needs of end consumers can be quickly responded, and the cost is close to traditional large-scale assembly line. Parallel manufacturing applies industrial robots, Internet of things, cloud computing, AR and AI technologies comprehensively to build virtual factory in Cloud that carries out decision-making and management simultaneously, with highly automated production equipments in workshop. Meanwhile, it combines with smart knitting factories to build a global distributed collaborative production management platform based on parallel manufacturing architecture system through virtual reality interaction, distributed manufacturing, managed and controlled through Cloud.

During the last couple of years, the digital transformation of industrial processes is propelled by the emergence and rise of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). The latter is based on the extensive deployment of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies in the manufacturing shopfloor, as well as on the seamless and timely exchange of digital information across supply chain participants. The benefits of Industry 4.0 have been already proven in the scope of pilot and production deployments in a number of different use cases including flexibility in automation, predictive maintenance, zero defect manufacturing and more. Despite early implementations and proof-of-concepts, CPPS/IIoT deployments are still in their infancy for a number of reasons, including: Manufacturers’ poor awareness about digital manufacturing solutions and their business value potential, as well as the lack of relevant internal CPPS/IIoT knowledge. The high costs that are associated with the deployment, maintenance and operation of CPPS systems in the manufacturing shopfloors, which are particularly challenging in the case of SME (Small Medium Enterprises) manufacturers that lack the equity capital needed to invest in Industry 4.0. The time needed to implement CPPS/IIoT and the lack of a smooth and proven migration path from existing OT solutions. The uncertainty over the business benefits and impacts of IIoT and CPPS technologies, including the lack of proven methods for the techno-economic evaluation of Industry 4.0 systems. Manufacturers’ increased reliance on external integrators, consultants and vendors. The absence of a well-developed value chain needed to sustain the acceptance of these new technologies for digital automation. In order to alleviate these challenges, three European Commission funded projects (namely H2020 FAR-EDGE (http://www.far-edge.eu/), H2020 DAEDALUS (http://daedalus.iec61499.eu) and H2020 AUTOWARE (http://www.autoware-eu.org/)) have recently joined forces towards a “Digital Shopfloor Alliance”. The Alliance aims at providing leading edge and standards based digital automation solutions, along with guidelines and blueprints for their effective deployment, validation and evaluation. The present book provides a comprehensive description of some of the most representative solutions that offered by these three projects, along with the ways these solutions can be combined in order to achieve multiplier effects and maximize the benefits of their use. The presented solutions include standards-based digital automation solutions, following different deployment paradigms, such as cloud and edge computing systems. Moreover, they also comprise a rich set of digital simulation solutions, which are explored in conjunction with the H2020 MAYA project (http://www.maya-euproject.com/). The latter facilitate the testing and evaluation of what-if scenarios at low risk and cost, but also without disrupting shopfloor operations. As already outlined, beyond leading edge scientific and technological development solutions, the book comprises a rich set of complementary assets that are indispensable to the successful adoption of IIoT/CPPS in the shopfloor. The book is structured in three parts as follows: The first part of the book is devoted to digital automation platforms. Following an introduction to Industry 4.0 in general and digital automation platforms in particular, this part presents the digital automation platforms of the FAR-EDGE, AUTOWARE and DAEDALUS projects. The second part of the book focuses on the presentation of digital simulation and digital twins’ functionalities. These include information about the models that underpin digital twins, as well as the simulators that enable experimentation with these processes over these digital models. The third part of the book provides information about complementary assets and supporting services that boost the adoption of digital automation functionalities in the Industry 4.0 era. Training services, migration services and ecosystem building services are discussed based on the results of the three projects of the Digital Shopfloor Alliance. The target audience of the book includes: Researchers in the areas of Digital Manufacturing and more specifically in the areas of digital automation and simulation, who wish to be updated about latest Industry 4.0 developments in these areas. Manufacturers, with an interest in the next generation of digital automation solutions based on Cyber-Physical systems. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2019.","","Book","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097986136"

Fruit must be kept at low temperatures to preserve quality and to slow down biochemically-driven food degradation. Along the cold chain, heterogeneities in temperatures are present among individual products, which influence the resulting product quality, causing significant food losses. This study presents a thermo-fluid dynamic model of a single mango fruit to better understand the convective cooling behavior of fruits with more complex, non-spherical shapes and a heterogeneous composition. To explain the biochemical and biological processes affecting the product's final quality, experimental data from the literature are used to calibrate kinetic rate laws for the prediction of different quality attributes (overall quality, flesh firmness, titratable acidity, total soluble solids and vitamin content) over time. The accuracy of airflow modeling and of applying a realistic fruit shape are assessed. It is quantified how much higher airspeeds lead to faster cooling of the pulp and seed, and how strong non-uniform temperature heterogeneities are inside the fruit. From sensitivity analysis, air temperature has the most impact on fruit temperature during cooling, while thermal properties and fruit size have a minor influence. The evolution of the quality attributes is shown at different temperatures, and the heterogeneities in quality within the mango fruit are also investigated. The obtained insights will help advance cooling process optimization for other complex-shaped, multi-material fruit and vegetables. © 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070935380"

Manufacturing systems should rapidly respond to these disruptions. This can be made possible by introducing new smart engineering methods and technologies to enable realisation of high level of reconfigurable and dynamic manufacturing processes to improve the overall performance of manufacturing plants. This paper investigates a methodology to develop a digital model for a fuel-cell assembly system and then utilises the developed model to automatically generate machine's Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) code, connectivity, and process data records. These automatically generated parts can then be used in order to create a Cyber Physical System (CPS). The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the automatic generation of the control code and structure it in order to be effectively and efficiently used in industrial applications. The on-going DIGIMAN project [1], which aims to deliver a proof of process fuel-cell assembly system for the automotive industry, is being used as a proof of concept to validate the proposed methodology and framework. © 2019 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070921810"

We conceptualize an entirely different approach to analyzing the risk profiles of supplier performance under uncertainty by utilizing the data analytics capabilities in digital manufacturing. Digital manufacturing peculiarly challenge the supplier selection by the dynamic order allocations, and opens new opportunities to exploit the digital data to improve sourcing decisions. We develop a hybrid technique, combining simulation and machine learning and examine its applications to data-driven decision-making support in resilient supplier selection. We consider on-time delivery as an indicator for supplier reliability, and explore the conditions surrounding the formation of resilient supply performance profiles. We theorize the notions of risk profile of supplier performance and resilient supply chain performance. We show that the associations of the deviations from the resilient supply chain performance profile with the risk profiles of supplier performance can be efficiently deciphered by our approach. The results suggest that a combination of supervised machine learning and simulation, if utilized properly, improves the delivery reliability. Our approach can also be of value when analyzing the supplier base and uncovering the critical suppliers, or combinations of suppliers the disruption of which result in the adverse performance decreases. The results of this study advance our understanding about how and when machine learning and simulation can be combined to create digital supply chain twins, and through these twins improve resilience. The proposed data-driven decision-making model for resilient supplier selection can be further exploited for design of risk mitigation strategies in supply chain disruption management models, re-designing the supplier base or investing in most important and risky suppliers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063342587"

ARTI models architecture elements of reality as intelligent beings in a dominant position relative to their related decision-making components modelled as intelligent agents. The reviews start with overviews of the creation process, the structural elements - holon classes and the features - aggregation, specialization, abstraction levels, flexibility and scalability. The needs that led to the evolution of PROSA into ARTI are analysed: the difficulties to spread the architecture in the research community and industry, the lack of suitability to act as reference architecture for Cyber-Physical Production Systems and Industrial Internet of Things framework in the Industry 4.0 vision of future manufacturing. The reviews discuss the elements and coverage of ARTI, and the translation of basic and staff PROSA holons into new abstract categories: intelligent beings-agents, types-instances, and resources-activities. It is appreciated that, beyond the problem of terminology of PROSA holons difficult to apply in other domains than manufacturing, the move to ARTI assures in-depth interoperability, access to the world-of-interest through digital twins that interact with smart control systems influencing thus these intelligent beings (e.g., plant, shop floor, healthcare system, environment facility, supply chain, service system) into the desired behaviours. From the software implementing point of view, most of the reviewers agreed on the fact that none of the programming languages except for Erlang provided acceptable levels of viability and sustainability for PROSA application classes. An interesting point of view is formulated about the possibility to use ARTI for Enterprise Integration and Interoperability. The present discussions appreciates the new ARTI reference architecture together with D-MAS pattern as an enhanced model to build flexible, intelligent and robust control systems based on prioritizing situation awareness and real-world interoperability. This scientific discussion about the new ARTI model, initiated, presented and critically analysed for the first time in the SOHOMA scientific community needs to be continued by the research community for enrichment and industry adoption. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059097427"

They are often produced by a complex network of suppliers the control of which is hard, time consuming and in many cases almost impossible for a single company. Hence, it is a common practice for malicious actors to target the ICT product supply chain assuming that some members have lax security practices or lag behind in terms of using the latest solutions and protocols. A single company cannot assure the security of complex ICT systems and cannot evaluate risks and therefore, to be successful it needs to tap into a wider network of ICT product developers and suppliers, which in essence leads to forming an ecosystem. We propose in this study that such an ecosystem should be established and managed on the bases of its members capabilities, which in this means capacity to meet desired goals, i.e., security and privacy requirements in a dynamic business context. The proposal is illustrated on the case of the ICT product called IoTool, which is a lightweight IoT gateway. The IoTool uses various third-party components such as sensors and actuators supplied by different vendors. Copyright © 2020 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

The Industry 4.0 has the ambition to revolutionize industry management and business processes, enhancing the productivity of manufacturing technologies through field data collection and analysis, thus creating real-time digital twins of industrial scenarios. Moreover, it is vital for companies to be as “smart” as possible and to adapt to the varying nature of the digital supply chains. This is possible by leveraging IoT in Industry 4.0 scenarios. In this paper, we describe the renovation process, guided by things2i s.r.l., a cross-disciplinary engineering-economic spin-off company of the University of Parma, which a real manufacturing industry is undergoing over consecutive phases spanning a few years. The first phase concerns the digitalization of the control quality process, specifically related to the company's production lines. The use of paper sheets containing different quality checks has been made smarter through the introduction of a digital, smart, and Web-based application, which is currently supporting operators and quality inspectors working on the supply chain through the use of smart devices. The second phase of the IIoT evolution—currently on-going—concerns both digitalization and optimization of the production planning activity, through an innovative Web-based planning tool. The changes introduced have led to significant advantages and improvement for the manufacturing company, in terms of: (i) impressive cost reduction; (ii) better products quality control; (iii) real-time detection and reaction to supply chain issues; (iv) significant reduction of the time spent in planning activity; and (v) resources employment optimization, thanks to the minimization of unproductive setup times on production lines.

These include the digitization of their industrial processes, the integration of telemetry data collection methods, managing status updates within digital twins. These changes must have the appropriate interfaces with the business logic of the company itself as well.Among the many targeted corporate functions of Industry4.0, logistics and supply chain management applications are especially complex, due to the heterogeneity of the stakeholders' infrastructures. Complex asset tracking and digital twin functionalities are highly desirable by this industrial segment. While global players push their own generic approaches that require costly customization, there are no low-cost and easy-to-use solutions available for small and medium scales.This paper presents a retrofittable, cost effective solution for managing and tracking various assets within shop floors and logistics using high accuracy indoor positioning combined with RFID-based tracking features, even across the supply chain. The system is supported by the Arrowhead framework, which offers a service oriented approach together with its scalable local cloud concept, allowing interoperability among stakeholders inside and outside organizations. © 2019 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070867244"

This paper is devoted to the investigation of the challenges and effects of IoT and Digital Twins integration. The goal is to ensure the formation of a methodological basis for calculating the cumulative effect of the accelerated implementation of digital twins, which should become a source of reserved growth and increase the competitiveness of a modern industrial enterprise. Our study revealed that in the context of the modern digital transformation of industry, these concepts are mutually penetrating and complementary for two reasons: 1) Big Data being the basis of IoT implementation are not valuable in themselves, since they are characterized by the lack of systematization of huge data arrays presented in different metrics. Big Data gain value in solving specific business problems; 2) The digital transformation of industry determines the shift in the value of the assets of a company towards such a specific asset as Digital Twins. In this regard, IoT should be considered as one of the environments for creating the most valuable asset of companies in a digital economy - Digital Twins.

Vertical integration describes the connection or merging of processes between top and shop floors inside the very same organization to enable comprehensive possibilities for optimization, allowing – virtually as side effect – for the customized production of batch size one orders. Both fields offer interesting issues, for example how to gain insight into what kind of effects a possible transformation could have prior to conducting said transformation – maybe assembly of a new production line, reengineering of a supply chain or managing the change of a business process due to new market constraints. Alterations naturally come at a price, thus, testing the consequences by implementation is nearly always infeasible. To lessen the cost of change, transformations can be analyzed using digital twins – by modelling real world machinery, work pieces and processes, then simulating them and their interaction. The authors present a possibility to implement digital twins in arbitrary magnitude and level of detail. A web-based specification and simulation environment allows for modelling both high-level business processes and field level as well as activities across companies' borders, comprising everything between. ©ECMS Mauro Iacono, Francesco Palmieri, Marco Gribaudo, Massimo Ficco (Editors).","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068742668"

Building a digital twin platform network can provide enterprises with a comprehensive view of products, manufacture, supply chain, customer experience, and profitability, which is conducive to the construction of a sustainable business model. The purpose of this paper is to study how enterprises use digital twin platform networks to generate economic, social and environmental benefits in various dimensions and their coupling relationships. Based on the literature review, this paper constructs a five-dimensional framework of a sustainable business model, and analyses the coupling relationship between dimensions. Using Haier as a way to verify the five-dimensional framework, it explores the dynamic mechanism of the Haier digital twin platform network, constructs an integrated framework based on coupling perspective and compares it with other two home appliance enterprises. The study shows that, through the digital twin platform network, enterprises can remove the disadvantage of focusing on a single product life cycle, and form a comprehensive network, so as to promote overall sustainable upgrades. This paper draws generic strategies and digital transformation suggestions for enterprises to innovate the sustainable business model.

With 'lower for longer' oil prices the need for enterprise wide optimization in the upstream and midstream oil & gas industry is greater than ever. The terms Digital Oil Field/Digital Gas Field/Digital Twin are being utilized to extol the virtue and value of big data analytics, model based asset optimization and supply chain optimization. These provide optimization solutions in ways not previously possible with multiple unintegrated systems, processes and procedures. Ad-hoc deployment of applications across multiple sites become difficult to integrate horizontally for management of safe and optimized operations and vertically up to Business ERP (enterprise resource planning) level to give useful and timely business insights. With careful planning coupled with deep OT (operations/operational technology) and process knowledge, an integrated enterprise wide supply chain and asset operations and management system can unlock significant hidden value. This is enabled by the correct and efficient integration of many systems and the efficient collection, management and use of huge amounts of data. As the industry needs to 'do more with less' getting this integration right to enable the desired outcomes and functionality is critical. This paper summarizes the current state of the art solutions, with examples, that enable optimized CSG/CBM (coal seam gas/coal bed methane) wells to LNG (liquified natural gas) plant process, asset and business management to deliver this functionality and these desired outcomes. Although applicable for all upstream to LNG supply chains this paper focuses on the unconventional CSG/CBM to LNG supply chain which has some specific issues not generally found in the conventional oil & gas supply chain. © 2019, Unconventional Resources Technology Conference (URTeC).","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085666212"

Its idiosyncratic characteristics can be especially useful in the aircraft industry, a highly technologically-based sector, wherein manufacturers of components are governed by stringent technical standards, the aim of which is to certify and monitor the whole component production process. In addition, the sector makes significant use of additive manufacturing technologies to perform the rapid prototyping of product components, realized through the supply chain, hence reducing time-to-market, while ensuring quality and containing costs. Starting from these premises, the paper focuses on the phases characterizing the metal additive manufacturing process, in which a component for the aircraft industry can be produced and proposes a digital twin for additive manufacturing in the aircraft industry through the exploitation of Blockchain solutions. In doing so, the paper provides a conceptual answer to securing and organizing the data generated through an end-to-end additive manufacturing process in the aircraft industry and underlines how companies exploiting Blockchain can build secure and connected manufacturing infrastructure. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065156908"

The DF, as the digital twin of physical facilities, replicates the facility in terms of installed machinery, material handling equipment, and layout. DF is supported by a formal ontology that describes the capabilities of the factory in a formal and machine-understandable fashion and enables capability quantification and visualization. Through exploring and querying the Digital Factories, companies can develop a deeper and more precise understanding of the technological capabilities of prospective suppliers, thus making more informed decisions when building supply chain partnerships. By creating their digital twins, small to medium-sized manufacturers can significantly improve their visibility in the virtual space. Digital Factories also enable automated supply chain formation.

Products the company delivers are highly engineered, complex systems. By 2004, the digital transformation was underway. Initial building blocks of its foundational manufacturing elements were rolled out, PLM CAD/CAM along with Teamcenter.  New product designs were being modeled in 3D, and data was being managed within Teamcenter. At the same time, the company rolled out the first stage of a new factory IT infrastructure, enabling the digital integration of internal manufacturing equipment. In 2013, Rolls-Royce began investigating opportunities to expand its digital transformation strategies to include integration across its global supply chain. The company partnered with UI LABS, an innovation accelerator based in Chicago, as a founding member of its proposal team for the DoD-sponsored Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute (DMDII). The company is now building upon its ever-growing foundational elements and expanding PLM into MBD and MBE.  When integrated across a product lifecycle and throughout the supply chain, MBD/MBE will help enable a full digitally integrated enterprise. The Digital Twin of the production facility combined with the digital product and process design enables virtual simulation, verification and optimization of the production flow for make, assembly and service operations.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032574223"

Backed by the rapidly emerging Web3 technology “Blockchain,” we significantly extend traditional approaches to effectively incentivize broader participation by an interdisciplinary “value network” of diverse players. Ranging from skilled individuals (the “citizen scientist” and the “garage entrepreneur”) and more established research institutions to companies with their infrastructures, equipment, and services, the novel platform approach enables all stakeholders to jointly contribute to value creation along more decentralized supply chain designs including research and technology development (RTD). A blockchain-enabled token economy efficiently leverages the “Wisdom of the Crowds” and secures “trust” and transparency by reputation systems requiring “skin in the game” from contributors. Prediction markets are created for guiding decision making, planning, and allocation of funding; competitive parallelization of work and its validation from independent participants substantially enhances quality, credibility, and speed of project outcomes in the real world along the entire path from RTD, fabrication, and testing to eventual commercialization. This novel, Blockchain-backed, open platform concept can be led by a corporation, academic entity, a loosely organized group, or even “chieflessly” within a smart-contract encoded Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The proposed strategy is particularly attractive for highly interdisciplinary fields like microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip systems in the context of manifold applications in the Life Sciences. As an exemplar, we outline the centrifugal “Lab-on-a-Disc” technology. Rather than engaging in all sub-disciplines themselves, many smaller, highly innovative actors can focus on strengthening the product component distinguishing their unique selling point (USP), e.g., a particular bioassay, detection scheme, or application scenario. In this effort, system integrators access underlying commons like fluidic design, manufacture, instrumentation, and software from a more resilient and diversified supply chain, e.g., based on a verified pool of community-endorsed or certified providers.

The Multitier Digital Twin approach is validated by modelling four tiers of Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) company: business processes, operations workflow processes and work cells operations. The simulation study is performed to evaluate the achieved results. The guidelines are developed to connect and integrate business process tier models with operations workflow and work cell tiers models.

An SC for personalised production has redundant inventory and operation capacity; therefore, it requires a system that can achieve recoverability for operation resilience. Thus, a standalone cyber physical system (CPS) has limitation for SC control with MTO. To solve this problem, the CPS must be coordinated, and a systematic approach is required. This study proposes a cyber physical logistics system (CPLS) that is coordinated with the agent cyber physical production systems in a multi-level CPS structure. This multi-level architectural framework is designed to provide technical functionalities for resilient SC control. The service composition procedures of technical functionalities on the distributed digital twin (DT) simulation are divided into type and instance stages. The operation procedures of the DT application and technical functionality of the DT engine are suggested. The proposed CPLS has appropriate service composition and operation for the bullwhip and ripple effects, which are the two main SC-related problems. This study illustrates an early case of CPLS that can minimise differences among assets using distributed DT simulation; furthermore, the study establishes an SC and production plan based on the DT simulation results. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087647804"

Blockchain has the capacity to transform the industries disruptively as it presents new features like smart contracts, tokenization of content, eliminating counterfeit products, supply chain improvement, digital twins, and end-to-end security. This paper presents a blockchain-based model for distributed and collaborative digital twin environments which is becoming indispensable in new 'Any 4.0' era. The proposed model includes a public or private authority in the digital twin ecosystem providing non-repudiation of blockchain transactions, holistic security and privacy preservation. The proposed technique is based on the 'X-by-design' and 'X-as-a-service' principles which can be discussed as a novel model for better security, accountability and integrity in decentralized mechanisms. In order to elucidate, two case studies are described where the digital twin operations, stakeholders' activities and regarding transactions are stored on a blockchain. © 2019 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076742071"

These requirements on data are of a special importance in supply chain (SC) risk management for predicting disruptions and reacting to them. Digital technology, Industry 4.0, Blockchain, and real-time data analytics have a potential to achieve a new quality in decision-making support when managing severe disruptions, resilience, and the Ripple effect. A combination of simulation, optimization, and data analytics constitutes a digital twin: a new data-driven vision of managing the disruption risks in SC. A digital SC twin is a model that can represent the network state for any given moment in time and allow for complete end-to-end SC visibility to improve resilience and test contingency plans. This chapter proposes an SC risk analytics framework and explains the concept of digital SC twins.

During 2004-14, fish exports from Brazil declined from 107,000 tons to 34,000 tons while fish imports grew from 158,000 tons to 403,000 tons due to low productivity of Brazilian AFs. Hence it is important to understand opportunities for productivity improvement of these fisheries. With productivity improvement and further expansion, sustainability issues should be considered carefully. In a project funded by the Newton Fund in the UK and FAPESC in Brazil, we explored drivers of sustainable development of AFs in Santa Catarina via a stakeholder workshop and field visits. We also interacted with officials at the EPAGRI, the research and agricultural extension organization of the State of Santa Catarina. Findings of the workshop and field visits are briefly summarized below but will be elaborated during the presentation at the conference. • The level of technology use in aquafarms in Brazil is basic. There were one or two instances of old mechanical technology but there is no integration with the latest electronic, IoT technologies. • There is general lack of awareness of sustainability issues among most AFs. Since water supply is abundant, they tend to think pollution is not an issue. Without adequate efforts in treating the waste water before they leave aquafarms, pollution issues could be the most significant limiting factor for future expansion of AFs. • There is a lack of awareness of the fish supply chains as most AFs do not directly deal with supermarkets or final consumers. • Lack of financing and access to banks is also a serious bottleneck for future expansion. • The AFs tend to work with traditional models of fishing. More training on new business models (e.g., (i) linking directly to market, (ii) using cooperative structures to ensure large supplying power and consequently winning bargaining power, and (iii) developing future contracts for supply of fish to the market to ensure all fish produced are sold on time) will help the entire AF industry. • New Internet of Things (IoT) technologies should be developed with local culture in mind. It can be automatic resulting in fewer labour requirements but should be supplemented with proper guidance documents (e.g., user manuals or online provision). Working with local knowledge centres such as EPAGRI is crucial for continued diffusion of these technologies to all eligible AFs and for regular advice on maintenance. •Lack of supporting infrastructure for aquaculture development, e.g. analytic systems, ERP, e-learning, regulations, government support, legal frameworks, etc. On the basis of the study, three areas can be recommended for future IoT and Big Data applications: (i) improving the monitoring and control of water quality, such as oxygen and temperature, by using sensors and remote control digital technologies; (ii) optimising and managing the fish feed to improve resource efficiency; (iii)-enabling fish farmers to have better access to information (e.g. suppliers information, weather, market demand and prices, costs, etc), knowledge and technical support and expert advice via mobile Apps. © 2019, IEOM Society International.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079279795"

This article elaborates digital twins approach to the current challenges of knowledge management when Industry 4.0 is emerging in industries and manufacturing. There are not very many studies, which have elaborated on this important question from a knowledge management perspective. This article summarised this ongoing discussion. We observe three major shifts ongoing with digital twins: first, there is a drive towards the added complexity of the environments modelled by digital twins. Secondly, the paradigm offers a general shift from analysing ex-post data to predicting the future. Third, in the future, digital twin can move from cyber-physical integration of physical and virtual entities towards cyber-physical integration of larger interconnected networks presenting a new digital twin interaction-puzzle. The identification of these shifts and their implications is a new addition to the scientific literature in the field.

This need for constructing digital twins is caused by the low reliability and stability of supply chains due to the faults in their operation. These faults are a result of risks in the supply chains which can be consolidated into two types. The first type is operational risks. These are the current risks of the supply chain itself caused by an uncertainty of supply and demand as well as by an obstructed flow of information along the supply chain. The second type is critical risks caused by force majeure. These risks disrupt the normal operation of the supply chain and critically reduce the most important performance indicators of the company such as annual income and profits. Risks happen due to natural or man-made causes such as fires and floods in the distribution centers or at production facilities, legal disputes with suppliers, strikes, terrorist attacks on logistics facilities and others. Dynamic simulation and analytical optimization are two dominant technologies for managing risks of the supply chains, which helps to increase their reliability and stability if failures occur. Through optimizing and simulating of the supply chains, companies can generate new infor-mation about the impact of failure and influence the supply chain and its performance by looking at various scenarios that simulate the locations of failures, the duration and recovery policies. An analysis of the literary sources shows that there is no single approach to build the concept for a supply chain digital twin. This article gives an overview of the literature according to this problem and offers the author's point of view on the concept for a supply chain digital twin. © 2020, International Journal of Mathematical, Engineering and Management Sciences.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090409318"

These innovations, among other emerging entrepreneurial endeavors, will result in vast market disruption and innovation-driven growth; in Bower and Christensen’s (1995) terms, these trends encompass ‘disruptive innovation’. While the entrepreneurial landscape is fraught with constant bursts of innovation that reciprocally propel development of progressive modes of production, technology and business dynamics, entrepreneurship education (EE) does not reflect these innovations. The expectation is that EE will provide the relevant entrepreneurial-driven knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs), along with agile, creative mindsets and other psychological aspects (for example, self-effacement, motivation, intentions) to enable the implementation of such innovations into a viable, entrepreneurial business. However, research shows that EE for adult entrepreneurs still pursues conservative models, rather than forward-looking ones. This discrepancy between entrepreneurship and EE is echoed throughout the program types: the market is witnessing a gigantic outpouring of enabling systems (Matlay, 2006, 2008; Politis, 2005; Winkler et al., 2018), such as incubators, accelerators, academic programs for entrepreneurs, co-working spaces, corporate-based innovation centers, impact hubs, scaling accelerators, and digital accelerators, among others, but this substantial flux brings with it the question of relevant preparation for the entrepreneurial journey. The massively growing number of programs seems confusing to the learner-entrepreneurs, who need to determine which program will fit their needs as well as those of their stakeholders (Bischoff et al., 2018; Kariv et al., 2018; Steiner et al., 2018). Taken together, while entrepreneurship is characterized by vast innovation and boosted developments, the consequent implementation performance, which is attained through EE, is lagging behind due to the existing conventional EE modalities. These incongruities are the impetus for this book’s undertaking: to bring fresh views and perspectives on these prevailing gaps by illustrating innovative pedagogies and innovative programs through research studies, springing from an array of academic approaches, from various countries and various entrepreneurship programs. Specifically, this book aims to bridge some of the existing and evolving gaps between the entrepreneurship landscape and EE, to introduce a ‘disruptive innovation’-based look into EE, thus providing the groundwork for a better, more vigorous fit between the learners’ needs and EE focuses. This book offers new concepts and cases embodying EE and entrepreneurship learning (EL) in different countries, thereby covering a wide range of educational undertakings for entrepreneurs. The book aims to provide convergent, rather than divergent, perspectives on EE and EL. It sets out to deliver a constructive and focused research and learning agenda that closely matches the education and learning needs of nascent entrepreneurs and the corresponding programs that are being offered at all levels of the educational system. © Alain Fayolle, Dafna Kariv and Harry Matlay 2019.

Since on LED datasheets there is only limited information provided, companies designing LED luminaires spend a lot of effort gathering the required input of LED details to be able to design reliable products. Small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) do not have the bandwidth to gather such input and solely rely on empirical approaches leading to approximated luminaire designs, while larger companies use advanced hardware and software tools to characterize parts, design versions, and finally optimize all design steps. In both cases, considerable time and money is spent on prototyping, sampling, and laboratory testing. Digitalization of the complete product development (also known as Industry 4.0 approach) at all integration levels of the solid state lighting (SSL) supply chain would provide the remedy for these pains. The Delphi4LED European project aimed at developing multi-domain compact models of LED (for a consistent, combined description of electronic, thermal, and optical properties of LEDs) as digital twins of the physical products to support virtual prototyping during the design of luminaires. This paper provides an overview of the Delphi4LED approach aimed at supporting new, completely digital workflows both for SMEs and larger companies (Majors) along with some comparison with the traditional luminaire design. Two demonstration experiments are described: One to show the achievable benefits of the approach and another one to demonstrate the ease of use and ability to be accommodated in a larger scale product design for assessing design choices like e.g., number and type of LEDs versus electrical/thermal conditions and constraints, in a tool agnostic manner. © 2019 by the authors","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066875752"

In addition, these networks comprise heterogeneous entities such as machinery, control systems, digital twins and interfaces to the external supply chain making them susceptible to cyber attacks that cripple the manufacturing enterprise. Therefore, it is necessary to analyse, comprehend and quantify the essential metrics of providing targeted and optimised cyber security for manufacturing enterprises. This paper presents a novel data-driven approach to develop the essential metrics, namely, Damage Index (DI) and Vulnerability Index (VI) that quantify the extent of damage a manufacturing enterprise could suffer due to a cyber attack and the vulnerabilities of the heterogeneous entities within the enterprise respectively. A use case for computing the metrics is also demonstrated. This work builds a strong foundation for development of an adaptive cyber security architecture with optimal use of IT resources for manufacturing enterprises. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063267731"

Specifically, people all over the world, including those in the most advanced nations have had to go without medical supplies and personal protective equipment. Scarcity of essentials increases anxiety and uncertainty exacerbating unproductive behaviors like hoarding and price gouging. Left to market forces, such unfair practices are likely to aggravate hardships and increase the loss of lives. Thus, there is a critical need to ensure safe distribution of food and essential supplies to all citizens to sustain them through challenging times. To this end, we propose a simple, affordable and contact-less robotic system for preparing and dispensing food and survival-kits at community scale. The system has provisions to prevent hoarding and price gouging. Design, simulation, and, validation of the system has been completed to ensure readiness for real world implementation.

In such domain, the search for ""agility"" has come to be one of the most requested features. As a result, considerable research has been conducted to design manufacturing systems which embody manufacturing flexibility. It is in this context where the evolution of the supply-chain based concept of Mini Factories is relevant, as it allows a network-like interconnectivity between assets by setting up factories inside the premises of the principal manufacturer. It is stated that at the core of Industry 4.0 implementation, every asset (e.g. a machine, software, sensor or actuator, etc.), should be modeled via an Asset Administrative Shell (AAS). AAS is a knowledge structure that provides a description of the asset, its technical functionality and its relationships to other assets. It can be viewed as the bridge between the physical world and the IoT world or, in other words, the data model from where the digital twin stems from. In this paper we present a methodology to create Asset Administrative Shells in a Mini Factories context. We argue that our approach, effectively embodies concepts related to Industry 4.0 in a modular way, allowing the much-desired agility. By using our proposed methodology, Model Factory @ARTC has been able to create a seamless integration of assets into our factory of the future, demonstrating the connectivity and some of the enhanced capabilities of Industry 4.0. © 2019 The Author(s).

Only companies that can prepare for and embrace change will survive in the new business environment. Businesses in industries that do not adapt to the new rules of the game will become obsolete in market share. The transformation of a supply and logistics chain, from an old model to a digital one, requires strict organization. It is a great effort on a human level, with the ease of requiring low operating costs. The reward for achieving this change is openness to a global business, where the possibilities grow exponentially and proportionally with the capacity of the available work team. Big data emerges as the beginning of the digitization of supply chains and logistics in the global world. The new environment requires a permanent update of the services software based on market needs. Generally, this does not imply changing technology immediately.

One of such concepts is Digital Twin and researchers have made some advancement on both its conceptual development and technological implementations. However, in practice, there are many different definitions of the digital-twin concept. These different definitions have created a lot of confusion for practitioners, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Therefore, the adoption and implementation of the digital-twin concept in manufacturing have been difficult and slow. In this paper, we report our findings from a survey of companies (both large and small) regarding their understanding and acceptance of the digital-twin concept. Five supply-chain companies from discrete manufacturing and one trade organization representing suppliers in the automotive business were interviewed. Their operations have been studied to understand their current digital maturity levels and articulate their needs for digital solutions to stay competitive.

Low temperatures reduce the rate of several temperature-driven biochemical degradation reactions, thereby preserving the quality of these perishable products. However, every single refrigerated shipment is unique and encounters a distinct cooling history, including suboptimal temperature deviations, which manifest themselves as a unique quality evolution. This introduces a large variability in end-product quality for the consumer, which complicates logistics and can increase product losses. Digital twins can map this currently uncharted quality evolution. A digital twin is a virtual model of a heat-sensitive biological product in a cold chain, in which all relevant biophysical transport processes are simulated. The twin is linked to the real fruit by monitored environmental parameters in the real cold chain (such as cooling air temperature and humidity). The present study employs the citrus cold chain as a case study for digital twinning, to demonstrate in-silico the variability in quality evolution between different citrus shipments from South Africa to the Netherlands. We also identify trade-offs between a comprehensive set of quality attributes such as biochemical degradation reactions, mass loss, low temperature-induced chilling injury, and phytosanitary mortality of pests. Our results provide essential insights into the variability in the remaining shelf life days for the different shipments, which varied between 8 and 10 days. Furthermore, the risk of chilling injury and condensation was predicted for these shipments. This information is indispensable for multiple stakeholders in the refrigerated supply chain. They can use this information for better decision-making in planning logistics and dynamically adjusting pricing. Additionally, these findings can help prolong the shelf life and minimize variability in end-product quality, thereby reducing product losses and the associated loss of embodied energy in these cold chains. © 2020 International Institute of Refrigeration.

The existing scientific literature on Digital twin primarily refers to a product entity or a physical machine but the core concept can be applied to the entire product lifecycle, particularly the assembly process of a complex product system. In addition, majority of existing work focus on the Digital Twins of individual machines on a shop-floor. This paper focuses on aspects the process to build DTs of a production schedule for a complex defence weapon system. The process is inherently high variety and low quantity in a very manual assembly process. This paper consists of three elements. (1) It reviews the current state of art along with the research gap and discusses how DT can become a tool to the manual assembly process. (2) A data-driven simulation algorithm is proposed to model the complex and manual manufacturing process in a generic-reusable way. (3) Finally, an appropriate complex industrial case study is studied to exemplify the proposed framework. Results demonstrate that the production managers can make more informed early decisions that can help bring assembly schedules in check and limit wasteful efforts when disruptions in the supply chain of parts sourced for the assembly occur. © 2020 The Authors.

For the purposes of this article, the problem of implementing supply chain digital twins is considered in terms of the interests of various stakeholders and their contribution to the development of the supply chain Digital Twins market. The study of Digital Twins effects analysed the indicators of digital business transformation. It is proved that the digital transformation of Russian industry should be directly linked to the development of Digital Twins. Based on the analysis of the effects of Digital Twins development in the automotive, petrochemical, oil and gas, transport, and construction industries, a map representing the relation between interests of stakeholders and their contribution to the development of the Digital Twins market has been developed. This map contains both the interests of key stakeholders in the Digital Twins market and their possible contribution to the interests of each stakeholder group. The developed methodological toolbox is an important component of the formation of institutional support measures by the state for the development of the digital industry. © Excelingtech Pub, UK.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087802462"

Evolution of multi-agent systems from purely decision-making support and simulation tool to cyber-physical system including Digital Twins and fully autonomous systems is analyzed. The main paper contribution is the proposed conceptual framework for designing autonomous cyber-physical multi-agent systems for adaptive resource management. It is shown in the paper that, in cyber-physical multi-agent systems for adaptive resource management, the ontology-customized multi-agent engine and ontology-based model of enterprise are forming ontology-driven “Digital Twin” of the enterprise providing opportunity to combine operational scheduling of resources with ongoing real-time simulations and evolutional re-design of configuration of enterprise resources. The functionality and architecture of the autonomous cyber-physical multi-agent systems for adaptive resource management are developed to support for the full cycle of autonomous decision making on resource management. Time metrics for measuring event-based response time and level of adaptability of autonomous cyber-physical multi-agent systems for adaptive resource management are proposed.

The authors developed the original Reliability-Risk model as a “trade-off” tool for ranking conceptual designs as a function of reliability. We summarize the original Reliability-Risk model and algorithm and discuss the process of updating the standard Integration Definition Function Modeling (IDEF0) technique with the IoT. Inserting the updated IDEF0 into the Reliability-Risk modeling framework creates a dynamic closed-loop system. We identified a concept for using a probabilistic workflow to automate the new closed-loop system and discuss a Reliability-Risk sensitivity approach. The Reliability-Risk model ranked five conceptual packaging designs against 17 criteria for incorporation into the supply chain. The authors use a Multi-Criteria-Decision System (MCDS) to establish the rankings. The paper re-visits the original example to include data (the IoT) such as shock, temperature, and humidity obtained from various nodes in the logistics cycle. After the sensor data are incorporated, updated systems specification and reliability models resulted in a new ranking. We will discuss the results of the rankings. Current research in developing the Digital Twin and Digital Thread are lacking in the area of logistics modeling. The incorporation of Discrete Event Simulation models to simulate transportation, handling, and storage shows promise to address these shortcomings. Therefore, we will briefly discuss our approach on incorporating Discrete Event Simulation modeling into the Reliability-Risk-IoT model to create a “logistics twin.

Refrigeration is also key to enable successful transcontinental export to distant markets. To minimize the environmental impact of the cold chain and to optimize logistics, a better knowledge of the fruit quality evolution within individual shipments would be extremely valueable. For this purpose, a digital fruit twin is developed, based on mechanistic modeling. This digital twin simulates the thermal behavior of mango fruit throughout the cold chain, based on the measured environmental temperature conditions, namely the air temperature in the vicinity of the fruit. At the same time, the evolution of associated quality attributes, due to enzymatically-driven, temperature-dependent biochemical degradation reactions, is quantified. Also, a biophysical counterpart of real mango fruit – an innovative fruit simulator sensing device – was developed and used for model validation of fruit pulp temperatures. We identified – in-silico – the impact of the unique delivery air temperature history and cold chain length on fruit quality evolution for actual maritime vs. airfreight transport pathways. Digital twins were found to provide complementary insights in the thermophysical behavior of fruit, particularly in supply chains of very perishable species, and for storage at low airflow rates. Such mechanistic modeling enabled to understand, record, and predict where temperature-dependent fruit quality loss occurs in each supply chain. In that way, digital twins can help to improve refrigeration processes and logistics to reduce food losses, thereby making the refrigerated supply chain greener. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070210024"

Such decisions are difficult in this environment as managers encounter uncertainty and risks. The study investigates establishing or moving distribution facilities in the global supply chain by considering costs, fulfilment, trade uncertainties, risks under environmental trade-offs and disruptive technologies. Design/methodology/approach: This paper combines the possibilities and probabilistic scenarios for a supply chain network by proposing the novel Robust Optimisation and Mixed Integer Linear Programming (ROMILP) method developed under the potential uncertainty of demand while considering the costs associated with a four-tier supply chain network. ROMILP has been solved in a real-time logistics environment by applying a case study approach. Findings: The solution is obtained using an exact solution approach and provides optimality in all tested market scenarios along the proposed global logistics corridor. A sensitivity analysis examines potential facility location scenarios in a global supply chain context. Research limitations/implications: Logistics managers can apply the ROMILP model to test the cost-benefit trade-offs against their facility location and relocation decisions while operating under uncertainty. Future research is proposed to extend the literature by applying data from the OBOR logistics corridor. Originality/value: This study is the first to examine sustainable dimensions along the global logistics corridor and investigate the global container traffic perspective. The study also adds value to the Middle East logistics corridor regarding facility location decisions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090305918"

In particular, the production and logistics coordination between actors in the supply chain is often a difficult activity which draws significant resources. Also, such coordination requires continuous revisions and updates to be performed. In Industry 4.0, the digital twins paradigm is currently adopted to represent, simulate and test the behavior of one or more machines and production plants belonging to an organization. This paper introduces the AgileChains paradigm, extending the digital twin paradigm to supply chains and the dynamics of their participants. This extension also positively affects the reactivity and resilience of the internal processes in case the supply chain has to be reconfigured. We propose a novel conceptual framework that combines Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) with Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), in order to create service oriented systems suited for exchanging data in a dynamic and adaptive way. In addition, we propose a novel data management mechanism capable of finding the right balance between the internal needs of each organization when handling their data and the need to securely and efficiently export data in the supply chain (cf. smart data movement ). Finally, we plan to define governance tools to model and manage the supply chain that treat agility as a first-class citizen. These tools will allow users to dynamically and predictively change the involved actors, as well as the nature of the exchanged data and the data exchange policies, focusing in particular on adverse, risk-prone events, so to minimize the risk and to optimize the supply chain performance both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.

Since on LED datasheets there is only limited information provided, companies active in LED luminaire design need to spend lots of effort on gaining additional information before their luminaire is ready for production. SMEs often use empiric approaches leading to approximated luminaire designs, while bigger companies use advanced hardware and software tools to characterize parts, design versions and finally optimize all design steps. In both cases, considerable time and money is spent on prototyping, sampling, and laboratory testing. Digitalization (also known as Industry 4.0 approach) at all integration levels of the SSL supply chain would provide the remedy for these pains. The Delphi4LED European project aims at developing multi-domain compact models of LED (mixing electronic, thermal, and optical properties of LEDs) as digital twins of the physical products to support virtual prototyping during the design of luminaires. This paper provides a quick overview of the Delphi4LED approach aimed at supporting workflows both for SMEs and bigger companies along with some comparison with the traditional luminaire design. © 2018 IEEE.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057502080"

In particular, the production and logistics coordination between actors in the supply chain is often a difficult activity which draws significant resources. Also, such coordination requires continuous revisions and updates to be performed. In Industry 4.0, the digital twins paradigm is currently adopted to represent, simulate and test the behavior of one or more machines and production plants belonging to an organization. This paper introduces the AgileChains paradigm, extending the digital twin paradigm to supply chains and the dynamics of their participants. This extension also positively affects the reactivity and resilience of the internal processes in case the supply chain has to be reconfigured. We propose a novel conceptual framework that combines Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) with Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), in order to create service oriented systems suited for exchanging data in a dynamic and adaptive way. In addition, we propose a novel data management mechanism capable of finding the right balance between the internal needs of each organization when handling their data and the need to securely and efficiently export data in the supply chain (cf. smart data movement ). Finally, we plan to define governance tools to model and manage the supply chain that treat agility as a first-class citizen. These tools will allow users to dynamically and predictively change the involved actors, as well as the nature of the exchanged data and the data exchange policies, focusing in particular on adverse, risk-prone events, so to minimize the risk and to optimize the supply chain performance both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. © ESREL 2020-PSAM15 Organizers.

To use the information that is obtained from a supply chain that is always connected and working, “digital twins” (a virtual clone of its physical elements, processes and systems) are used. As soon as real conditions change, those changes are made also along the virtual world (digital twin) in real time and that allows an instantaneous simulation of the environment and generates the opportunity to take better, more optimized and faster decisions. All that is translated into a competitive advantage and an improvement in performance. This paper will establish a review of the main concepts around the supply chain from the perspective of digitalization. A review of the main concepts related to supply chain will be done in this paper using the digitalization perspective. © 2019 by the authors.

In the present paper, I discuss the value to agriculture from AI over the next decade. The more immediate applications will be to improve precision information about what is happening on the farm by improving what is being detected and measured. A consequence of this are more accurate alerts to farmers. Another is an increased ability to understand why phenomena occur in farm systems, so as to improve their management. From improved data and understanding come improved predictions, enabling more optimal decisions about how to manage farm systems and stimulating the development of decision support and recommender systems. In many cases, robotics and automated systems will remove much of the need for human decision-making and improve farm efficiencies and farm health. Artificial intelligence will also be needed to enable organisations to harness the value of information distributed throughout supply chains, including farm data. Digital twins will also emerge as an important paradigm to improve how information about farm entities is organised to support decision-making. There are also likely to be negative impacts from AI, such as disruption to the roles and skills needed from farm workers, indicating the need to consider the social and ethical impacts of AI each time a new capability is introduced. I conclude that understanding these challenges more deeply tends to highlight new opportunities for positive change. © 2020 CSIRO.","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057276288"
